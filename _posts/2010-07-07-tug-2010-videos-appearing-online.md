Following the <a href="http://www.tug.org/tug2010/">TUG 2010</a> conference, those of us who did not manage to go do not need to feel too left out. <a href="http://river-valley.com/">River Valley Technologies</a> are <a href="http://river-valley.zeeba.tv/conferences/tug-2010">putting them on-line</a>. At the moment, there are only a couple of videos available, but more will follow. I'll report on anything I think is of particular note as the page fills up.
