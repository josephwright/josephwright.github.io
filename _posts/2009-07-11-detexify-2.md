Daniel Kirsch has updated his [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org) symbol-finding web page. Daniel says

> It is now much more flexible in adding symbols from different packages.
Unfortunately I wasn't able to import the old training data so
basically the system is empty. But it is now possible to train symbols
explicitly.

The new site looks even more impressive than the first version, if in need of a little training!
