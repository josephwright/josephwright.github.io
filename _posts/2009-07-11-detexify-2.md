Daniel Kirsch has updated his <a title="Detexify" href="http://detexify.kirelabs.org">Detexify</a> symbol-finding web page. Daniel says
<blockquote>It is now much more flexible in adding symbols from different packages.
Unfortunately I wasn't able to import the old training data so
basically the system is empty. But it is now possible to train symbols
explicitly.</blockquote>
The new site looks even more impressive than the first version, if in need of a little training!
