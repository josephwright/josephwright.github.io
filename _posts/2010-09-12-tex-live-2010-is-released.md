A quick note about [TeX Live 2010](https://tug.org/texlive/). After a while in pretesting, it's now released and so new updates are appearing. I've just updated my system (I'm actually on a campsite!) and all seems to be working. Hopefully the DVDs will turn up soon enough and will be off to members of users groups, such as [UK-TUG](http://uk.tug.org/). As I've mentioned before, this has some new refinements such as built-in shell escape for EPS to PDF conversion, so the update looks like a good one to me.
