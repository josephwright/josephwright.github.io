Martin Scharrer has put together a hand reference list of <a href="http://www.scharrer-online.de/wiki/LaTeX/Docs/macros2e">macros for programming LaTeX2e</a>. This covers stuff in the LaTeX kernel itself, rather than add-ons such as <a title="Tool-box for LaTeX programmers using e-TeX" href="http://ctan.org/pkg/etoolbox">etoolbox</a>. This should be a real benefit to newer LaTeX programmers, as finding all of this information has in the past been quite awkward.
