The dust has only just settled on <a href="http://tug.org/2011">TUG 2011</a>, but I see that there is already a date set for <a href="http://tug.org/2012">TUG 2012</a>. The meeting is planned for the 16th to the 18th of July next year, in Boston (US). For those of us who find that clashes happen, it's probably worth penciling this one in.

Now, the next step is to raise the money to go â€¦
