After a bit of a hiatus, I've got back into fixing the [bugs in `beamer`](https://github.com/josephwright/beamer/issues), starting with some 'low hanging' ones and [scheduling a few more](https://github.com/josephwright/beamer/milestones). Hopefully there won't be too many new issues as a result, but if there are then [please log them](https://github.com/josephwright/beamer/issues/new)!
