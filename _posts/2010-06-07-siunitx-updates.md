Following the release of version 2 of [`siunitx`](https://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx), you might have noticed that there have been rapid minor updates (v2.0a, v2.0b and v2.0c). I thought I'd just say that most of this is to make sure that the version that ends up in [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) 2010 is as good as possible. There are the inevitable bugs to sort, especially with compatibility with version 1, and I want to get things working as well as possible. I suspect there will be a few more releases in quick succession!
