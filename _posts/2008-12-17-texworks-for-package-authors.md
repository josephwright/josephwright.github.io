The <a href="http://www.texworks.org">TeXworks</a> project is targetted at making life easier for new users of TeX. The clean, Mac-inspired interface certainly makes writing TeX documents very easy, as does the buit-in PDF viewer with SyncTeX ability. As a long time user of a more “traditional” editor (<a href="http://www.winedt.com/">WinEdt</a>), I've found that TeXworks is good for all of my editing, to the point that I'm not longer using WinEdt.  The parred-down feature set really suits my way of working (I've never liked all of the editor icons in a traditional IDE), and even at this pre-release stage the advanced features (such as regex searching) are impressive.
