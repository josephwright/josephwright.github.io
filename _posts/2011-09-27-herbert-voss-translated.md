I recently stumbled across the fact that [UIT](http://www.uit.co.uk/) have published English translations of several of Herbert Voß's (La)TeX books. Herbert is a prolific author of TeX support material, perhaps most notable the [_Math Mode_](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/voss-mathmode) guide. He's also the current maintainer of [PStricks](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/pstricks). As you'd therefore expect, the titles available include [_Typesetting Mathematics with LaTeX_](http://www.uit.co.uk/BK-TMWL/HomePage) and [_>PS Tricks_](http://www.uit.co.uk/BK-PSTricks/HomePage), along with a [_LaTeX Quick Reference_](http://www.uit.co.uk/BK-LREF/HomePage) and [_Typesetting Tables with LaTeX_](http://www.uit.co.uk/BK-TTWL/HomePage). That's right: there is a whole book just for setting tables correctly! The translations all seem to have appeared over the last year or so, and I think would be great additions to the bookshelf.
