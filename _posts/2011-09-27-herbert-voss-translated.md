I recently stumbled across the fact that <a href="http://www.uit.co.uk/">UIT</a> have published English translations of several of Herbert Voß's (La)TeX books. Herbert is a prolific author of TeX support material, perhaps most notable the <em><a href="http://www.ctan.org/pkg/voss-mathmode">Math Mode</a></em> guide. He's also the current maintainer of <a href="http://www.ctan.org/pkg/pstricks">PStricks</a>. As you'd therefore expect, the titles available include <em><a href="http://www.uit.co.uk/BK-TMWL/HomePage">Typesetting Mathematics with LaTeX</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.uit.co.uk/BK-PSTricks/HomePage">PS Tricks</a></em>, along with a <a href="http://www.uit.co.uk/BK-LREF/HomePage"><em>LaTeX Quick Reference</em></a> and <em><a href="http://www.uit.co.uk/BK-TTWL/HomePage">Typesetting Tables with LaTeX</a></em>. That's right: there is a whole book just for setting tables correctly! The translations all seem to have appeared over the last year or so, and I think would be great additions to the bookshelf.
