Many readers will be familiar with [The LaTeX Community](https://latex.org/forum/)), an online forum for LaTeX advice that has been running now for a few years. The site was set up in 2007 by [Sven Weigand](http://www.sven-wiegand.de/), and has grown since then to over 56 000 posts.

Running such a big site is clearly not easy, and requires some expertise at the 'back end'. Sven has recently handed over running the site to Stefan Kottwitz, a moderator on the forum since soon after it was started. Stefan has [moved the site itself to a new machine](https://latex.org/forum/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=418:latex-communityorg-moves-to-a-new-server&amp;catid=43:news-latex-community&amp;Itemid=111), and is now [improving the features](https://latex.org/forum/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=420:new-maintainer&amp;catid=43:news-latex-community&amp;Itemid=111). Highlights include

- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- The ability to mark up inline code
- A quick method to link to package homepages on CTAN

Stefan's work rate in helping users is amazing, and I'm sure that he'll continue to add new ideas to The LaTeX Community!
