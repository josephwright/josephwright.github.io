Over the week-end, the copy of _Programming in Lua_ that I'd ordered arrived at the bookshop. So I've been able to make at least a small start on the book, and get some of the ideas into my head. Having looked at the first 40 or so pages, I can see why [Lua](https://www.lua.org) has been chosen for integration with TeX as [LuaTeX](http://www.luatex.org). Some TeX concepts are also Lua concepts (such as the scope of variables and the ability to re-define anything), and so the fit between the two languages looks good.  How that translates in practice I'll have to see.

What I have found to date is that you really don't want to be a beginner if you pick up _Programming in Lua_. The book starts with a lot of pretty complicated programming ideas, and without some background I'd be in trouble.  Luckily I've picked up bits and pieces over the years (from Basic, C and Perl, amongst other things), and so I'm not totally lost.  But for a book aimed at people starting off with the language, it is tough going.

The arrival of the book happily coincides with the release of LuaTeX 0.36.0, as announced on the [LuaTeX mailing list](https://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/luatex). There are a number of changes aimed at making more changes in the future, but at least I can now begin to understand what some of them mean!
