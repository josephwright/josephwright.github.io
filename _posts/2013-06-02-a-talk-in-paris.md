Yesterday I was in Paris, giving a talk to [GUTenberg](http://gutenberg.eu.org/) about LaTeX3 as part of their user meeting. The event was very well attended, and 'official' video recording will be available of all of the presentations. People seem very keen to hear talk I was giving, so I recorded the audio and have put it together with the [slides](http://www.texdev.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-01-LaTeX3.pdf) as a [video](https://vimeo.com/67504395) (thanks to [UK-TUG](http://uk.tug.org) for use of their Vimeo account!). I do hope it all makes sense!
