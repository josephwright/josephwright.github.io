The LaTeX team have over the past three years created `l3build`, a 'proper' tool which takes our previous testing and release scripts and converts them into some that can be used more widely of LaTeX developers. I talked about the early work [some time ago](/2014/05/25/lua-for-latex3-build-scripts/), and Frank Mittelbach and Will Robertson also [wrote about it](https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb35-3/tb111mitt-l3build.pdf) for [_TUGBoat_](https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/).

Promoting `l3build` as a general tool means that new ideas come up, and we've been working on that (as well as other things) quite a bit. To keep developments clear, we've recently moved the `l3build` code to [a new home on GitHub](https://github.com/latex3/l3build). This means it's now separate from the [main LaTeX3 repository](https://github.com/latex3/latex3), but that the history is clearer. This change has meant new ideas have come 'out of the woodwork', and have started accumulating in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/latex3/l3build/issues). It looks like an exciting time for `l3build`: I'm expecting more features to appear and for that to help new developers pick it up as their release technology. Hopefully the result will be more well-designed and tested LaTeX code.
