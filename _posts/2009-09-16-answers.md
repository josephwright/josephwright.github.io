There have been a few questions recently on the <a title="MiKTeX Project Page" href="http://www.miktex.org/">MiKTeX</a> list about the <a title="Production of solution sheets in LaTeX2e" href="http://ctan.org/pkg/answers">answers</a> package. It has been removed from version 2.8, and this turns out to be because of the license it has. Although the original author is no longer about in the TeX community, he did leave the <a title="The Comprehensive TeX Archive Network" href="http://www.ctan.org/">CTAN</a> maintainers with the power to re-assign the package. So I've taken over, which mainly means altering the license to the <a title="The LaTeX project public license" href="http://www.latex-project.org/lppl/">LPPL</a>. So hopefully answers will re-appear in TeX distributions soon.
