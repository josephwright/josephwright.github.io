I see on the <a href="http://www.texworks.org/">TeXworks</a> mailing list that Jonathan Kew has posted <a href="http://code.google.com/p/texworks/downloads/list">new builds</a> of the ‘bleeding edge’ experimental code. For those of us who use them (and find them pretty stable) this will add a number of refinements, from the look of the change log.
