I see on the [TeXworks](https://tug.org/texworks) mailing list that Jonathan Kew has posted [new builds](http://code.google.com/p/texworks/downloads/list) of the ‘bleeding edge’ experimental code. For those of us who use them (and find them pretty stable) this will add a number of refinements, from the look of the change log.
