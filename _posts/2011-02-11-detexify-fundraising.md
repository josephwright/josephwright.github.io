<a href="http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html">Detexify</a> has rapidly become a standard tool for LaTeX users, allowing you to draw a symbol and be pointed in the direction of how to enter it in LaTeX. People who've followed Detexify from the start will know that it began as a ‘bit of fun’ project, but it's clearly grown since then! There is now a <a href="http://detexify.posterous.com/detexify-needs-help">fundraising call</a> to pay for hosting the site: these things stack up. Hopefully, the community can find a good solution to this: it's a great service, and I think is something that we should all look to encourage if we can.
