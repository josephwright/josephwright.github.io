The increasingly-popular [{TeX} Q&amp;A](https://tex.stackexchange.com/) site is holding it's first [moderator election](https://tex.stackexchange.com/election).Anyone with a reputation of 300 or greater can stand, which means a good portion of the community is eligible. The nomination stage runs for 7 days, so there is no immediate panic to decide to stand!
