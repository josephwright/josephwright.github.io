If you are involved in (La)TeX for any length of time, you notice that using TeX is _very_ popular in German-speaking countries. [DANTE](http://www.dante.de/), the German-speaking TeX user group, is _big_, and there are several German-language TeX websites out there. They've now been joined by a new German-language TeX blog, [TeX Welt](http://texwelt.de/). This has popped-up following some discussion on the [TeX-sx](https://tex.stackexchange.com) chat system, and is being hosted by [Stefan Kottwitz](http://texblog.net/) (a man with a server farm in his house!). Of course, we don't all speak fluent German, but I'll certainly be keeping an eye on the new site: always more to learn!
