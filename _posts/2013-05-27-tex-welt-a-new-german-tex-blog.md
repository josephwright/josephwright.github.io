<p>If you are involved in (La)TeX for any length of time, you notice that using TeX is <em>very</em> popular in German-speaking countries. <a href="http://www.dante.de/">DANTE</a>, the German-speaking TeX user group, is <em>big</em>, and there are several German-language TeX websites out there. They've now been joined by a new German-language TeX blog, <a href="http://texwelt.de/">TeX Welt</a>. This has popped-up following some discussion on the <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com">TeX-sx</a> chat system, and is being hosted by <a href="http://texblog.net/">Stefan Kottwitz</a> (a man with a server farm in his house!). Of course, we don't all speak fluent German, but I'll certainly be keeping an eye on the new site: always more to learn!</p>
