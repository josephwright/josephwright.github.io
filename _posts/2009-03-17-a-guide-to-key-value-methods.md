I have a second draft for [TUGBoat](http://www.tug.org/tugboat/) on the go at the moment: an [article on implementing key-value input](http://www.texdev.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/keyval.pdf). These are widely used in LaTeX packages, but are also usful in plain TeX. As well as the original [keyval](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/keyval) package, we have [xkeyval](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/xkeyval), [kvoptions](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/kvoptions) and [kvsetkeys](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/kvsetkeys) for managing key–value input. However, actually getting started with these as a LaTeX programmer can be somewhat difficult. The aim of the article is to lower the barrier to getting going with key-value methods. As well as the keyval-based information, the pgfkeys package (part of the [pgf](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf) bundle) is also covered (thanks to Christian Feuersänger).
