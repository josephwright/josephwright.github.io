Jonathan Kew has posted new ‘<a href="http://code.google.com/p/texworks/downloads/list">snapshots</a>’ for the experimental (v0.3) trunk of <a title="Lowering the entry barrier to the TeX world" href="http://www.texworks.org/">TeXworks</a>. As usual, these are for Windows and the Mac, with Linux users to compile themselves from the SVN (not usually difficult). Looking through the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/texworks/source/list">change list</a>, it looks like mainly small refinements rather than any big changes. Everything looks like it's working, which is the main thing!
