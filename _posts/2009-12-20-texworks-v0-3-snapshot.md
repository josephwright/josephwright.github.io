Jonathan Kew has posted new ‘[snapshots](http://code.google.com/p/texworks/downloads/list)’ for the experimental (v0.3) trunk of [TeXworks](http://www.texworks.org/). As usual, these are for Windows and the Mac, with Linux users to compile themselves from the SVN (not usually difficult). Looking through the [change list](http://code.google.com/p/texworks/source/list), it looks like mainly small refinements rather than any big changes. Everything looks like it's working, which is the main thing!
