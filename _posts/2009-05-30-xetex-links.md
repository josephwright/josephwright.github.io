The <a title="XeTeX" href="http://www.tug.org/xetex/">XeTeX</a> page on the <a title="The TeX Users Group" href="http://www.tug.org">TUG</a> website has been overhauled. It now has a set of useful links about XeTeX and using it. Well worth a visit. Unsurprisingly, there are a lot of XeLaTeX links, but there should be something for everyone. I particularly like the <a title="XeTeX showcase" href="http://www.tug.org/mactex/src/Demos/XeTeX-showcase/">showcase</a>: some of these would be very hard with traditional TeX!
