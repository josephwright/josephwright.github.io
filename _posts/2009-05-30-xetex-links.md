The [XeTeX](http://www.tug.org/xetex/) page on the [TUG](http://www.tug.org) website has been overhauled. It now has a set of useful links about XeTeX and using it. Well worth a visit. Unsurprisingly, there are a lot of XeLaTeX links, but there should be something for everyone. I particularly like the [showcase](http://www.tug.org/mactex/src/Demos/XeTeX-showcase/): some of these would be very hard with traditional TeX!
