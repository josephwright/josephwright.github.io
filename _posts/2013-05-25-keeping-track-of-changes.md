[Moving my code](http://www.texdev.net/2013/04/25/moving-from-mercurial-to-git/) from [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org) to [GitHub](http://github.com) has shown me (once again) the need to keep my changes to my code very organised. There was quite a bit of work to do getting all of the issues migrated, and it wasn't helped by the fact that I've been less than perfect in keeping each commit I make focussed on one thing. A timely reminder that it's important to be careful if you write a lot of code.
