I get a reasonable stream of e-mails about my LaTeX packages, mainly [achemso](http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=achemso) and [siunitx](http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=siunitx).  As a rule, I try to answer queries within a day or two, especially if I can easily provide a solution. Minor bugs tend to get done in the same time frame, with bigger bugs and feature requests sometimes needing a couple of weeks.  There is the occasional “big problem” that needs more work, such as the list of issues that [siunitx version 2](http://siunitx.berlios.de) will hopefully deal with; these don't really have a timescale at all, except I let people know that!  I tend to keep an eye out on [comp.text.tex](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/topics) and the [LaTeX Community](http://latex-community.org/) for questions about my packages, although often other people manage to get in first with good answers.

All of this raises the question “why”: after all, this is a hobby for me.  I guess that as I've put a lot of work into the packages I want them to work well.  So bugs, unclear documentation and new ideas all drive me to improve.
