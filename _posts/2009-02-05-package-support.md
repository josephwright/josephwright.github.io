I get a reasonable stream of e-mails about my LaTeX packages, mainly <a title="American Chemical Society publications" href="http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=achemso">achemso</a> and <a title="siunitx - A comprehensive (SI) units package" href="http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=siunitx">siunitx</a>.  As a rule, I try to answer queries within a day or two, especially if I can easily provide a solution. Minor bugs tend to get done in the same time frame, with bigger bugs and feature requests sometimes needing a couple of weeks.  There is the occasional “big problem” that needs more work, such as the list of issues that <a title="siunitx version 2" href="http://siunitx.berlios.de">siunitx version 2</a> will hopefully deal with; these don't really have a timescale at all, except I let people know that!  I tend to keep an eye out on <a title="comp.text.tex via Google Groups" href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/topics">comp.text.tex</a> and the <a title="LaTeX Community" href="http://latex-community.org/">LaTeX Community</a> for questions about my packages, although often other people manage to get in first with good answers.

All of this raises the question “why”: after all, this is a hobby for me.  I guess that as I've put a lot of work into the packages I want them to work well.  So bugs, unclear documentation and new ideas all drive me to improve.
