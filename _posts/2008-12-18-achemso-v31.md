My [achemso](https://ctan.org/pkg/achemso) package (for submissions to the [American Chemical Society](http://www.acs.org)) has been updated to v3.1. This brings two main developments. First, [JACS ](http://pubs.acs.org/journal/jacsat)Communications now automatically format in the journal style. This was asked for by the editorial office, and hopefully shows the approximate page requirement. Second, I've completely revised author affiliations. The original system was much too inflexible (just one main affiliation per author), and I've had a lot of questions about this. The new system gives you three macros:

- `\affiliation`
- `\altaffiliation`
- `\alsoaffiliation`

The last one is new, and should enable pretty much any combination of different addresses.
