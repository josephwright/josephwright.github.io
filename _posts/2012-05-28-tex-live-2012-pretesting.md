[Pretesting](https://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html) of the next TeX Live is well under way. This is very much evolutionary: no major changes from TL2011. So far I've had no surprises, but that does not mean a bit of caution is not needed (I will keep TL2011 installed too!).Â  Of course, pretesting works best if lots of people get involved, so if you are not doing something critical with documents, or you are comfortable switching between TeX Live installations, then grab a copy and help out.
