A new <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/LaTeX-Beginner%2527s-Guide-Stefan-Kottwitz/dp/1847199860/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1302006801&amp;sr=8-4">guide for LaTeX beginners</a> has just been published by <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/">Packt Publishing</a>. Written by Stefan Kottwitz (of <a href="http://texblog.net/">TeXblog</a> fame), it's a very hands-on  approach to teaching LaTeX. The book is filled with examples, and makes use of modern packages, editors and so on. Stefan has put a <a href="http://texblog.net/latex-archive/latex-general/beginners-guide/">summary of the contents</a> on his blog.

I saw the book before publication, so had an opportunity to make some suggestions. In general, Stefan's done a great job and it is a very readable and accessible guide The style is very much meant to be like a conversation with a knowledgeable friend, and I think this works really well.

However, there is a problem. The examples of LaTeX output in the book are poor: they've come out as low-resolution JPEGs. This really detracts from the a key point of using LaTeX in the first place: good-looking output. That's a shame, as if you picked up the book not knowing much about LaTeX you'd take one look at the output and think it was awful.

Overall, I can recommend the <em>content </em>book for helping new users, but with the warning ‘the real output from LaTeX looks much better than in the book’. So one to use as a complement to other texts, rather than alone.
