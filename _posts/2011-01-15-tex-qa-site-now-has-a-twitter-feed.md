Quite by accident I've discovered that the [{TeX} Q&A site](http://tex.stackexchange.com/) has a [Twitter feed](http://twitter.com/StackTeX/) of questions. I'm not a [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/) person myself, buy I guess a lot of people are. The feed seems to automatically notify you of new questions, so if Twitter is already part of your day-to-day set up then I guess this is one to follow.
