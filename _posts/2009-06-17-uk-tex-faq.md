Robin Fairbairns  released a new version of the [UK TeX FAQ](https://texfaq.org/) last week. As always, Robin has done a great job adding even more useful information to the list: over 400 questions and rising! In the [release notice](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/browse_frm/thread/f9cb1139969fb721#), Robin says

> my target is to make it possible for the faq to be a collaborative project

I hope that Robin gets some volunteers: I've already dropped him a line offer whatever help he needs. The FAQ are really vital to the TeX community, and I think everyone benefits from them.
