<a title="Robin Fairbairns" href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rf10/">Robin Fairbairns</a> released a new version of the <a title="UK TeX FAQ" href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html">UK TeX FAQ</a> last week. As always, Robin has done a great job adding even more useful information to the list: over 400 questions and rising! In the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/browse_frm/thread/f9cb1139969fb721#">release notice</a>, Robin says
<blockquote>my target is to make it possible for the faq to be a collaborative project</blockquote>
I hope that Robin gets some volunteers: I've already dropped him a line offer whatever help he needs. The FAQ are really vital to the TeX community, and I think everyone benefits from them.
