A while ago I <a title="arara: Making LaTeX files your way" href="http://www.texdev.net/2012/04/24/arara-making-latex-files-your-way/">posted about Arara</a>, a new tool to allow automated compilation of (La)TeX documents. As I said then, the big advantage of <a href="http://cereda.github.com/arara/">Arara</a> is that each document can be set up to follow distinct rules which are part of the document itself, rather than being part of the tool. Development of Arara has continued at some pace, and it's now available to <a href="https://github.com/cereda/arara/downloads">download with a cross-platform installer</a>. The bundle includes pre-built rules for common cases and an option to add to the system path (to make using it easier). So I'd expect a lot of people to try Arara out: it really is a very clear approach to automation.
