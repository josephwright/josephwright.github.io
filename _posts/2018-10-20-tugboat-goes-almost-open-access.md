Members of <a href="https://tug.org">TUG</a> might have seen a survey from the Board asking about the status of <a href="https://tug.org/tugboat"><em>TUGboat</em></a>. To date, the journal issues have been available online one year after publications. The Board were interested in how going open-access would affect the number of members.

The <a href="https://tug.org/TUGboat/survey.html?fbclid=IwAR3wRbeE5YYJI0ZVLXTN_BgqaV7L_B2r659l2y0VV1g1p-VXMuCEqNdluB8">analysis is now in</a>, and the result is clear: every issue <em>except the current one</em> is now publicly accessible. The reason is simple: most members will continue to join TUG even with direct access to <em>TUGboat</em> for free. Speaking personally, I like the print version, and I'm happy to pay for it. I'm also very mindful that we need TUG well beyond <em>TUGboat</em>, so I'm very happy with the decision.

Lets hope we see more people reading <em>TUGboat</em>, and joining TUG (and using TeX!) as a result.
