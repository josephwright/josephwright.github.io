<p>Learning LaTeX without a 'local guide' can be a challenge: it's one of the reasons I'm involved in running training courses for <a href="http://uk.tug.org">UK-TUG</a>. The people behind <a href="http://www.sharelatex.com">ShareLaTeX</a> have decided to make a <a href="http://youtube.com/sharelatex">series of videos</a> aimed at newer LaTeX users, covering the basics of LaTeX use, writing a thesis and also some more advanced topics (Ti<em>k</em>Z and <code>beamer</code>, for example).</p>

<p>There are currently about 25 videos, and I've watched all of the 'basic' ones (the LaTeX beginners series and the thesis series). The quality and presentation is pretty good: as well as well produced videos there are also transcripts for all of them, and of course the demos are available on ShareLaTeX. Of course, there are a few things I'd tackle differently, but the overall picture is pretty impressive. They've put a lot of work into the videos, and if you work through carefully (and take time to try the demos yourself) them I think you'll get a good grounding in using LaTeX.</p>
