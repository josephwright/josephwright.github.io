<p>Not content with running <a href="http://latex-community.org/">The LaTeX Community</a>, <a href="http://www.texample.net/">TeXample</a> and <a href="http://www.texdoc.net/">texdoc.net</a>, <a href="http://texblog.net/">blogging on TeX matters</a> and being a moderator on <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/">TeX Stack Exchange</a>, Stefan Kottwitz has now started a new site: <a href="http://www.pgfplots.net/">pgfplots.net</a>. The idea for the new site is simple: it's a place to collect great examples of plots, (primarily) made using using the excellent <a href="http://ctan.org/pkg/pgfplots"><code>pgfplots</code></a> package. Why do this? Plots are just graphics, but they are a very <em>special</em> form of graphic with particular requirements. As a <a href="https://www.uea.ac.uk/chemistry/people/profile/joseph-wright">working scientist</a>, I really appreciate the need for well-presented, carefully-constructed plots: they can make (or break) a paper.</p>

<p>At the moment, the selection of plots is of course quite small: the site is new and the room for 'artistic' work is perhaps a little more limited than in the <a href="http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/">TeXample gallery</a>. I'm sure it will soon grow, and we can all pick up a trick or two! (Don't worry: there will certainly be a few plots for chemists. Indeed, you might <a href="http://www.pgfplots.net/tikz/examples/author/joseph-wright/">already spot some</a>.)</p>
