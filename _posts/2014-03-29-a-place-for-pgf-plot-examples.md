Not content with running [The LaTeX Community](http://latex-community.org/), [TeXample](http://www.texample.net/) and [texdoc.net](http://www.texdoc.net/), [blogging on TeX matters](http://texblog.net/) and being a moderator on [TeX Stack Exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/), Stefan Kottwitz has now started a new site: [pgfplots.net](http://www.pgfplots.net/). The idea for the new site is simple: it's a place to collect great examples of plots, (primarily) made using using the excellent [`pgfplots`](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgfplots) package. Why do this? Plots are just graphics, but they are a very _special_ form of graphic with particular requirements. As a [working scientist](https://www.uea.ac.uk/chemistry/people/profile/joseph-wright), I really appreciate the need for well-presented, carefully-constructed plots: they can make (or break) a paper.

At the moment, the selection of plots is of course quite small: the site is new and the room for 'artistic' work is perhaps a little more limited than in the [TeXample gallery](http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/). I'm sure it will soon grow, and we can all pick up a trick or two! (Don't worry: there will certainly be a few plots for chemists. Indeed, you might [already spot some](http://www.pgfplots.net/tikz/examples/author/joseph-wright/).)
