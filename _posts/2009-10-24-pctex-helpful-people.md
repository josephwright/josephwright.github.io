I had a bug report for <a title="A comprehensive (SI) units package" href="http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=siunitx">siunitx</a> recently, concerning handling of the ohm symbol when the <a title="mtpro2 - PCTeXWeb" href="http://www.pctex.com/mtpro2.html">MathTime Pro</a> package has made <code>\Omega</code> slanted. As many of you will know, MathTime Pro is commercial, and so I was not totally sure I'd be able to sort the issue out. I dropped the suppliers, <a title="PCTeXWeb" href="http://www.pctex.com/">PCTeX</a>, a quick e-mail to see if they'd let me see the code for bug-fixing purposes, more in hope than expectation. I was pleasantly surprised to get an e-mail back the next morning, saying that this was no problem and even letting me download the fonts themselves for testing. A ‘pat on the back’ to PCTeX: very good service indeed.
