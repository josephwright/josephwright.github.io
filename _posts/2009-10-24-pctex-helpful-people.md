I had a bug report for [`siunitx`](https://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx) recently, concerning handling of the ohm symbol when the [MathTime Pro](http://www.pctex.com/mtpro2.html) package has made `\Omega` slanted. As many of you will know, MathTime Pro is commercial, and so I was not totally sure I'd be able to sort the issue out. I dropped the suppliers, [PCTeX](http://www.pctex.com/), a quick e-mail to see if they'd let me see the code for bug-fixing purposes, more in hope than expectation. I was pleasantly surprised to get an e-mail back the next morning, saying that this was no problem and even letting me download the fonts themselves for testing. A ‘pat on the back’ to PCTeX: very good service indeed.
