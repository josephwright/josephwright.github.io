The world seems to be full of LaTeX editors, particularly on Windows. One of the longest standing is [WinEdt](http://www.winedt.com/), a shareware editor that retains a strong following due to its powerful features. What has been missing in recent years is full Unicode support: not so much of an issue for me, but crucial for non-European users in particular. WinEdt 7 has now been released, and the big new feature is Unicode support in the editor. That can only be a good thing!
