The latest release of [`siunitx`](https://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx), version 1.1j, is on its way to [CTAN](https://www.ctan.org). This adds a new unit, the [gon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grad_(angle)), which I'd never heard of but apparently is bit in geophysics. I've also fixed something that I spotted recently when working on version 2: an infinite loop when using [`breqn`](https://ctan.org/pkg/breqn) and the textmode option for `siunitx`.
