I've been able to meet up with a few ‘TeX people’ over the past few months, as we've ended up in the same places and I've been able to put a face to an e-mail address. It's always interesting to meet other TeX users, and to talk not only about TeX but also about other things! I'm sure I'm not the only person who find this, so if anyone fancies talking about typesetting over a cup of coffee, do drop me a line. It might be nice to arrange some kind of informal get together (I know these are popular in some countries), if there is any interest.
