A quick note to say that I see that Will Robertson has set up a blog '[LaTeX Alive](http://latex-alive.tumblr.com/)'. Will is the person behind the very useful [`fontspec`](https://ctan.org/pkg/fontspec) package, which lets you choose system fonts easily when using one of the newer TeX engines ([XeTeX](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;id=xetex) and [LuaTeX](http://www.luatex.org/)). Will is also very active in the [LaTeX3 Project](http://test.latex-project.org/latex3.html). I'll be keeping an eye on his thoughts!
