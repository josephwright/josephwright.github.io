The <a title="The LaTeX Project" href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX Project</a> have asked me to join the LaTeX team: I've obviously been asking the right questions! At the moment I'd imagine I'll stick with what I've been doing: asking (hopefully useful) quesions on the <a title="LaTeX3 Mailing List" href="https://listserv.uni-heidelberg.de/cgi-bin/wa?A0=LATEX-L">LaTeX3 mailing list</a>. At some point I might commit a few changes to the <a title="LaTeX3 Code" href="http://www.latex-project.org/svnroot/experimental/trunk/">code</a>, but at the moment I'll stick to making suggestions.
