The [LaTeX Project](https://www.latex-project.org/) have asked me to join the LaTeX team: I've obviously been asking the right questions! At the moment I'd imagine I'll stick with what I've been doing: asking (hopefully useful) quesions on the [LaTeX3 mailing list](https://listserv.uni-heidelberg.de/cgi-bin/wa?A0=LATEX-L). At some point I might commit a few changes to the [code](https://www.latex-project.org/svnroot/experimental/trunk/), but at the moment I'll stick to making suggestions.
