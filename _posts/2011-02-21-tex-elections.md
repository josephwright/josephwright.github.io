The <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/">{TeX} Q&A</a> site is holding it's first <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/election">elections for community moderators</a>. The idea is that anyone with enough involvement in the community can vote: there are 8 candidates (including me). In contrast to some of the other <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a> sites, the election is a pretty calm affair, with a broad agreement on the nature of the job between the candidates. So quite how to make a decision on how to vote is not so easy. There are 8 days to think about it, and it's worth noting that there will be a <a href="http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/questions/986">chat session on Thursday</a>, so that people can put questions to the potential moderators. It will be interesting to see what gets asked.
