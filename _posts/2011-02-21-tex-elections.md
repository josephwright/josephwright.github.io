The [{TeX} Q&A](http://tex.stackexchange.com/) site is holding it's first [elections for community moderators](http://tex.stackexchange.com/election). The idea is that anyone with enough involvement in the community can vote: there are 8 candidates (including me). In contrast to some of the other [Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/) sites, the election is a pretty calm affair, with a broad agreement on the nature of the job between the candidates. So quite how to make a decision on how to vote is not so easy. There are 8 days to think about it, and it's worth noting that there will be a [chat session on Thursday](http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/questions/986), so that people can put questions to the potential moderators. It will be interesting to see what gets asked.
