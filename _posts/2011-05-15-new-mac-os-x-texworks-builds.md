As many readers will know, the [TeXworks](https://tug.org/texworks) project aims to provide a cross-platform TeX editor. A key requirement for that is that end-users can get a working version of the code. On Windows, that's not too bad as the main developers provide [pre-build binaries](http://code.google.com/p/texworks/downloads/list) with reasonable frequency. On Linux, there are a number of pre-built versions available for different distros, and building from the source tends to be a case of following a recipe. That leaves Mac OS X, where life has been awkward for a while. Luckily, after a period where not much happened there are now some experienced people looking at this. Charlie Sharpsteen seems to be getting on well with sorting out the issues, and has just [posted builds](https://tug.org/pipermail/texworks/2011q2/004189.html) for [Snow Leopard](https://github.com/downloads/Sharpie/TeXworks/TeXworks.0.5.0-813-33d0430-SLeopard.dmg) and for [Leopard](https://github.com/downloads/Sharpie/TeXworks/TeXworks.0.5.0-813-33d0430-Leopard.dmg) for the current development code. For me, these look good, so we're hopefully in a position where TeXworks on the Mac continues to grow.
