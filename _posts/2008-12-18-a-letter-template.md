Getting started with LaTeX can be an awkward buisness.  The [UK-TUG](http://uk.tug.org) are keen to help new users, and so I've been thinking about resources for beginners.  Letters are always a pain, as the default LaTeX class is not great.  I've posted a simple template, based on modifying the standard letter class, with full instructions [here](http://uk.tug.org/training/templates/).
