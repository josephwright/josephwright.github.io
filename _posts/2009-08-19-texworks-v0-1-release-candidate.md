Jonathan Kew has posted [new binaries](http://code.google.com/p/texworks/downloads/list) for [TeXworks](http://www.texworks.org/), with the idea that these are a release candidate for version 0.1 (which will be in TeX Live 2009 on Windows). Over the past few builds, we've got an icon, installer and the ability to associate .tex files with TeXworks. So things already look pretty good to me. I'm not sure what exactly is planned for v0.2, but somewhere along the line the plan is to include scripting, so perhaps that's the next big item to add. I'm already using TeXworks for my day-to-day work, so don't be put off by the low version number.
