The [TeX Q&amp;A site](http://tex.stackexchange.com/) is attractive to many people not only because of the way it works as a website, but also because the site makes it's data available for reuse. One thing that many people want to do with useful information is to print it. Now, you can simply print from your browser, but the layout won't necessarily be ideal. Enter the data back-end, andÂ  [TeXprinter](http://texprinter.sourceforge.net/). TeXprinter takes the raw information from a question and formats it as a PDF or LaTeX file. That way, you can print something that is actually readable! All of this is done in Java, so there is nothing to install beyond the program itself: great stuff.
