The yearly TUG conference for 2011 was originally scheduled to be held in Cairo, Egypt. Recent events there mean that there has been a rethink, and that [this year's event](https://tug.org/tug2011/) will now take place in Kerala, India, for the 19th to the 21st of October. This is going to be hosted by [River Valley](http://river-valley.com/), a typesetting company with a very strong interest in TeX.
