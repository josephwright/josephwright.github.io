A quick note to say that <a title="MiKTeX Project Page" href="http://www.miktex.org/">MiKTeX 2.8</a> was released on Tuesday. As I've already posted, the two points to note in the new version are the inclusion of <a title="TeXworks - lowering the entry barrier to the TeX world" href="http://www.texworks.org">TeXworks</a> and better support for multi-user systems.  There seem to be one or two teething issues, but I'm sure they'll soon be solved.
