Keeping a track of what TeX meetings are going on can be tricky. To help us all keep up, Karl Berry has just set up a new mailing list: [TeX meetings](https://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/tex-meetings). The idea is simple: it gives everyone a single place to post notices of meetings upcoming, and so to track what is happening in the TeX world. I've joined up (of course), and I'd encourage everyone else too as well. It should make life a lot easier, particularly if we can get  a good take-up from the people organising meetings.
