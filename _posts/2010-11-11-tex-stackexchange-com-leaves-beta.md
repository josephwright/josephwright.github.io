The new TeX questions site [tex.stackexchange.com](http://tex.stackexchange.com/) has been in beta for a few months now. Today, we've left the beta phase and gained a new look. There seems to be a good range of people on the new site, which seems to be working well as a complement to other places to ask questions. The next thing to happen is moderator elections, which I understand will be in about a month. It will be interesting to see if the current team get kept on!
