The [CTAN](http://www.ctan.org/) Team are currently testing a [new upload system](http://az.ctan.org/send/). There are several things going on with this new approach. First, if your material has been uploaded before then you can find it on the list of known packages, so various pieces of information are automatically available. Secondly, you can see the meta-data about your upload, for example the short README-like text you see in the CTAN database. That means you can correct/add to the entry, and hopefully makes Robin Fairbairns life a little less busy!

The default page for uploads includes a list of all of the packages that CTAN contains (more or less: I've not checked the entire list!). There's also [a page](http://az.ctan.org/send/enter_pkg) you can use if you know the package name for your upload. I like that one, perhaps as I know the names of all of my packages and the aforementioned list is rather long!
