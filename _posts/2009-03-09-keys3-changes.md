Having looked again at keys3, there are a number of things I'm not happy with. Some of these are things will result in dropping functionality that I don't believe is truely reliable.  There will be a lot of commits to the source repository in the next few days as I alter what there is there.  I'll post an update once I'm reasonable happy again.
