Not exactly a TeX topic directly, but done in LaTeX so I think it counts. <a href="http://www.uea.ac.uk/che">At work</a> recently we've been discussing providing our final year students with a model report. The problem is where to get one: if you take a real report, then this may help other students for the same group. So I've taken <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jorganchem.2006.08.023">some work from a few years ago</a> (in the group of <a href="http://www.soton.ac.uk/chemistry/research/danopoulos/danopoulos.html">Andreas Danopoulos</a>) and used some of it to write a model report. As the general structure might be useful to other people, you can take a look at the <a href="http://www.texdev.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Example-report.pdf">PDF</a> or <a href="http://www.texdev.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Example-report.zip">download the sources</a> here. As the report is quite short I've used the article class with some modifications: for a longer one I'd have gone with the report class. There are a few chemistry-specific things going on in the file, but most of it is quite simple LaTeX stuff.
