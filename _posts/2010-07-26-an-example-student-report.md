Not exactly a TeX topic directly, but done in LaTeX so I think it counts. [At work](http://www.uea.ac.uk/che) recently we've been discussing providing our final year students with a model report. The problem is where to get one: if you take a real report, then this may help other students for the same group. So I've taken [some work from a few years ago](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jorganchem.2006.08.023) (in the group of [Andreas Danopoulos](http://www.soton.ac.uk/chemistry/research/danopoulos/danopoulos.html)) and used some of it to write a model report. As the general structure might be useful to other people, you can take a look at the [PDF](/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Example-report.pdf) or [download the sources](/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Example-report.zip) here. As the report is quite short I've used the article class with some modifications: for a longer one I'd have gone with the report class. There are a few chemistry-specific things going on in the file, but most of it is quite simple LaTeX stuff.
