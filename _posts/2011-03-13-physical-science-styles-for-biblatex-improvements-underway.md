As regular readers will know, I'm a big fan of the <a title="Programmable Bibliographies and Citations" href="http://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex">biblatex</a> approach to producing bibliographies, particularly now that we have <a title="Biber now in TeX Live 2010" href="http://www.texdev.net/2011/03/10/biber-now-in-tex-live-2010/">Biber ‘on tap’</a>. There was a question on the <a title="{TeX}" href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/">{TeX} site</a> a while ago <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/10727/ieee-and-aip-bibliography-styles-in-biblatex">about an IEEE style</a>, and so I wrote the <a title="The ieee bibliography style for biblatex" href="http://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-ieee">biblatex-ieee</a> style as a partial answer. Doing that, I realised that my other biblatex styles need a bit of work. I've now revised both <a title="The nature bibliography style for biblatex" href="http://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-nature">biblatex-nature</a> and <a title="The science bibliography style for biblatex" href="http://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-science">biblatex-science</a> to make them more flexible, and also to improve their documentation. Next on the list is the <a title="The biblatex-chem bundle — biblatex styles for chemistry" href="http://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-chem">biblatex-chem</a> bundle: there are four styles in it, so it will take a little while. Once all of that is done, then I will take a look at the requirements for physics, which I'm going to call biblatex-phys.
