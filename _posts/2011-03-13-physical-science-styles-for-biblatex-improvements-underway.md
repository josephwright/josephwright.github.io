As regular readers will know, I'm a big fan of the [`biblatex`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) approach to producing bibliographies, particularly now that we have [Biber ‘on tap’](/2011/03/10/biber-now-in-tex-live-2010/). There was a question on the [{TeX} site](https://tex.stackexchange.com/) a while ago [about an IEEE style](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/10727/ieee-and-aip-bibliography-styles-in-biblatex), and so I wrote the [`biblatex-ieee`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-ieee) style as a partial answer. Doing that, I realised that my other biblatex styles need a bit of work. I've now revised both [`biblatex-nature`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-nature) and [`biblatex-science`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-science) to make them more flexible, and also to improve their documentation. Next on the list is the [`biblatex-chem`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-chem) bundle: there are four styles in it, so it will take a little while. Once all of that is done, then I will take a look at the requirements for physics, which I'm going to call biblatex-phys.
