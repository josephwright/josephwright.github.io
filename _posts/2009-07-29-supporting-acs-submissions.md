My [`achemso`](https://ctan.org/pkg/achemso) package has evolved over time to work quite well for submitting papers to the [American Chemical Society](http://www.acs.org) (ACS). However, I still get feedback about issues with the submission system. A lot of this comes from the fact that I write the package without any direct input from the ACS. So any issues tend to be brought up by users. The ACS publish around 30 journals, each with its own rules, and I have to work out what each one wants! Not an easy task: I've submitted to a couple, and never as the lead author. It's a challenge, but I hope that I'm doing more good than harm.
