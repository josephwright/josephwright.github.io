One of the useful features of [`biblatex`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) is _shorthands_, which can be defined in a BibTeX database and listed in the bibliography. A [long-standing request](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/29122/how-to-get-abbreviations-of-the-bibliography-into-the-list-of-shorthands) has been to make this even more powerful by allows several different kinds of shorthand, for example for journal abbreviations, general abbreviations, _etc._ This ability has now been added to the [development version of the package](https://github.com/plk/biblatex/), by generalising shorthands to 'biblists'. Of course, new features always need testing, so it would be great if interested users would grab the code and try it out!
