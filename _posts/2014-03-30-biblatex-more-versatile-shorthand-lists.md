One of the useful features of <a href="http://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex"><code>biblatex</code></a> is <em>shorthands</em>, which can be defined in a BibTeX database and listed in the bibliography. A <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/29122/how-to-get-abbreviations-of-the-bibliography-into-the-list-of-shorthands">long-standing request</a> has been to make this even more powerful by allows several different kinds of shorthand, for example for journal abbreviations, general abbreviations, <em>etc.</em> This ability has now been added to the <a href="https://github.com/plk/biblatex/">development version of the package</a>, by generalising shorthands to 'biblists'. Of course, new features always need testing, so it would be great if interested users would grab the code and try it out!
