There was an interesting e-mail to the <a title="TeXworks - lowering the entry barrier to the TeX world" href="http://www.texworks.org">TeXworks</a> mailing list today. Laurence Field has made a build of TeXworks available as an “<a title="Application Bundles for Linux" href="http://www.appbundles.org">Application Bundle</a>”, a pre-built drop-and-drag method for installing across Linux distributions. The idea is to make life as easy for Linux users as those on Macs (where the same drag-and-drop method is very common). Hopefully, this will help lower the entry barrier that bit further!
