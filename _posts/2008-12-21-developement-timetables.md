The need to have public timetables for large projects is something I mention quite a bit on the <a title="The LaTeX3 mailing list" href="https://listserv.uni-heidelberg.de/cgi-bin/wa?A0=LATEX-L">LaTeX-L list</a>. The <a title="LaTeX3 Homepage" href="http://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html">LaTeX3 </a>project has run for many years, and at the moment there is no public indication of when a “LaTeX3 kernel” might be available. As I've mentioned that I'm working on <a title="A comprehensive (SI) units package" href="http://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx">siunitx</a> v2, I guess I'd be hypocritical if I didn't have some kind of public statement about how things are going.

The plan at the moment is something like:

<ul>
    <li>Christmas period. Re-code number output and tables.</li>
    <li>January. Look at extending unit system to cope with more cases.</li>
    <li>February. Additional items (such as awkward symbols). Write basic documentation for v2.</li>
    <li>March. Public beta one for testing. Continue to write documentation</li>
    <li>June. Depending on feedback and success, release siunitx v2.</li>
</ul>

As you can see, I'm hoping to get everyhting revised for <a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive">TeXLive</a> 2009, having learnt from getting siunitx v1 out. Of course, this is subject to change (and other committments), but I think it's pretty achievable.
