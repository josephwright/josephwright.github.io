The need to have public timetables for large projects is something I mention quite a bit on the [LaTeX-L list](https://listserv.uni-heidelberg.de/cgi-bin/wa?A0=LATEX-L). The [LaTeX3 ](http://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html)project has run for many years, and at the moment there is no public indication of when a “LaTeX3 kernel” might be available. As I've mentioned that I'm working on [siunitx](http://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx) v2, I guess I'd be hypocritical if I didn't have some kind of public statement about how things are going.

The plan at the moment is something like:

- Christmas period. Re-code number output and tables.
- January. Look at extending unit system to cope with more cases.
- February. Additional items (such as awkward symbols). Write basic documentation for v2.
- March. Public beta one for testing. Continue to write documentation
- June. Depending on feedback and success, release siunitx v2.

As you can see, I'm hoping to get everyhting revised for [TeXLive](http://www.tug.org/texlive) 2009, having learnt from getting siunitx v1 out. Of course, this is subject to change (and other committments), but I think it's pretty achievable.
