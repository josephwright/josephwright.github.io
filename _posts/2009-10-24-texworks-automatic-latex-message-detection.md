The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/texworks/downloads/list">latest builds</a> of <a title="Lowering the entry barrier to the TeX world" href="http://www.texworks.org/">TeXworks</a> include support for scripting. There are not a lot of scripts just yet, but one that already looks good is LaTeX error message highlighting.

This already seems to work pretty well, and it's one of the few things I miss from my previous editor of choice (<a title="WinEdt" href="http://www.winedt.com/">WinEdt</a>). It can already jump to the line in question, when you choose the appropriate line in the listing.

Of course, this is only the first step in getting full scripting support for TeXworks. But things look good to me: the extra complexity to the interface is minimal, and it really opens up the possibilities for more advanced users.
