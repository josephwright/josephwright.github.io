I see that the [`biblatex`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) package has been updated to version 0.8c, and that there is now a [SourceForge page](http://sourceforge.net/projects/biblatex/) for the package. The later is just holding bug and feature tracking for the package, and no actual code. Placing development code in a public place means that your commits (or lack of them) are there for all to see, so I can see why keeping things private is attractive. Of course, just because nothing happens in public doesn't mean nothing is happening, and in any case these things are done as a 'hobby'.
