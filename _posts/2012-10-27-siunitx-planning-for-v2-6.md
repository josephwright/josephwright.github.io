I try to keep my [`siunitx`](http://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx) package ticking over, even though it's now pretty feature-rich. There are a [couple of issues](https://bitbucket.org/josephwright/siunitx/issues?milestone=v2.6) currently on the list for v2.6, and I'm planning to tackle those over the Christmas holidays. So now is a good time to log any feature requests you have for `siunitx`.
