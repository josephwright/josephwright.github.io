Those people on the [LaTeX-L list](https://listserv.uni-heidelberg.de/cgi-bin/wa?A0=LATEX-L) will have spotted a pretty important mail today: [_bibtex futures: url, doi, ?_](https://listserv.uni-heidelberg.de/cgi-bin/wa?A2=LATEX-L;9136aa51.1805), posted by Karl Berry.

The key questions raised there are focussed in two areas: whether the core BibTeX `.bst` files should support `url` and `doi` data (and if so how), and whether any efforts should be made to support Unicode data. These are important questions, and I'd encourage everyone to take a look, and to contribute. If anyone wants points raising, but is not subscribed to the list, drop me a mail or leave a comment and I'll forward it.
