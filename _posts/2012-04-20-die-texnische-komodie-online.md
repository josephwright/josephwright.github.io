TeX use is very strong in German speaking countries, and that means that the German-speaking TeX group, [DANTE](http://www.dante.de), is also very active. Their members magazine, _Die TeXnische Komödie_, has until recently only been available to members in print. However, it's now [available online](http://www.dante.de/DTK/Ausgaben.html). Non-members can see editions which are over a year old, similar to the case for [_TUGBoat_](https://tug.org/tugboat).
