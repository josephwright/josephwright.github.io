TeX use is very strong in German speaking countries, and that means that the German-speaking TeX group, <a href="http://www.dante.de">DANTE</a>, is also very active. Their members magazine, <em>Die TeXnische Komödie</em>, has until recently only been available to members in print. However, it's now <a href="http://www.dante.de/DTK/Ausgaben.html">available online</a>. Non-members can see editions which are over a year old, similar to the case for <a href="http://tug.org/tugboat"><em>TUGBoat</em></a>.
