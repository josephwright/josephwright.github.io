<a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/users/3094/paulo-cereda">Paulo Cereda</a> has updated his excellent <a href="http://texprinter.sourceforge.net/">TeXprinter</a> application to version 2, and even posted a <a href="http://vimeo.com/31378263">demonstration video</a>. For those of you who've missed it, TeXprinter takes the information available on the <a title="Unicode math versus document styling" href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/">TeX.sx</a> Q&amp;A site and turns it into aÂ  PDF or LaTeX source for printing. It's therefore a great way to get something more permanent than a webpage, and in a variety of formats. I guess the next phase is to take multiple questions and automatically build an entire book of frequently asked (La)TeX questions!
