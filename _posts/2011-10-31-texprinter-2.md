[Paulo Cereda](http://tex.stackexchange.com/users/3094/paulo-cereda) has updated his excellent [TeXprinter](http://texprinter.sourceforge.net/) application to version 2, and even posted a [demonstration video](http://vimeo.com/31378263). For those of you who've missed it, TeXprinter takes the information available on the [TeX.sx](http://tex.stackexchange.com/) Q&amp;A site and turns it into aÂ  PDF or LaTeX source for printing. It's therefore a great way to get something more permanent than a webpage, and in a variety of formats. I guess the next phase is to take multiple questions and automatically build an entire book of frequently asked (La)TeX questions!
