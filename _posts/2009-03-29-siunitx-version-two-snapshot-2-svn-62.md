As promised, a second snapshot of `siunitx` version 2 is now available:

- The source  (.dtx)
- [The user manual (PDF)](/uploads/2009/03/siunitx.pdf)
- The style file  (.sty)

This adds functioning unit processing to the test code, as well as sorting bugs in the previous snapshot (for example, a few problems with numbers). Testers will see that version 2 will provide a lot more units by default: this is a result of changing the method for defining units, making it much easier to avoid clashes with other packages. As with snapshot one, there are a lot of gaps in the existing code (for example, backward-compatibility!). Feedback is very welcome.
