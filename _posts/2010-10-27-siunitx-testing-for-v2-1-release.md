Anyone who follows the [BitBucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/josephwright/siunitx/) for [`siunitx`](https://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx) will have seen that I've made a lot of [commits](https://bitbucket.org/josephwright/siunitx/changesets) over recent days. If you look at the list of [open issues](https://bitbucket.org/josephwright/siunitx/issues?status=new&amp;status=open), you'll also see that it's got smaller and that some have been moved from targeting v2.1 to [targeting v2.2](https://bitbucket.org/josephwright/siunitx/issues?status=new&amp;status=open&amp;milestone=v2.2). I've been aiming to get v2.1 finished this month, and I've been working out what I can and can't do in that time frame.

The result is that the [code on BitBucket now](https://bitbucket.org/josephwright/siunitx/src/tip/siunitx.dtx) is what I'll release as v2.1, baring any remaining bug fixes. The idea is to have some new features, but not so many that I'll have introduced lots of new bugs. I hope that I've got the balance about right, and that there has been enough time for testing the new additions to the package. If all looks okay by the weekend I will be updating CTAN at the weekend. If you'd like to test it before then, either grab the code from BitBucket or, if you use TeX Live, try the [TLcontrib](http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/) installation method.

I'm hoping to work on v2.2 for a release early in the new year, probably late January. There are already a [few issues on the list for v2.2](https://bitbucket.org/josephwright/siunitx/issues?status=new&amp;status=open&amp;milestone=v2.2), but that may alter if there is a good case made for something else. Of course, I'll also have to avoid breaking anything!
