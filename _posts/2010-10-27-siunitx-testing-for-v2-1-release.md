Anyone who follows the <a href="http://bitbucket.org/josephwright/siunitx/">BitBucket repository</a> for <a title="A comprehensive (SI) units package" href="http://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx">siunitx</a> will have seen that I've made a lot of <a href="http://bitbucket.org/josephwright/siunitx/changesets">commits</a> over recent days. If you look at the list of <a href="http://bitbucket.org/josephwright/siunitx/issues?status=new&amp;status=open">open issues</a>, you'll also see that it's got smaller and that some have been moved from targeting v2.1 to <a href="http://bitbucket.org/josephwright/siunitx/issues?status=new&amp;status=open&amp;milestone=v2.2">targeting v2.2</a>. I've been aiming to get v2.1 finished this month, and I've been working out what I can and can't do in that time frame.

The result is that the <a href="http://bitbucket.org/josephwright/siunitx/src/tip/siunitx.dtx">code on BitBucket now</a> is what I'll release as v2.1, baring any remaining bug fixes. The idea is to have some new features, but not so many that I'll have introduced lots of new bugs. I hope that I've got the balance about right, and that there has been enough time for testing the new additions to the package. If all looks okay by the weekend I will be updating CTAN at the weekend. If you'd like to test it before then, either grab the code from BitBucket or, if you use TeX Live, try the <a href="http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/">TLcontrib</a> installation method.

I'm hoping to work on v2.2 for a release early in the new year, probably late January. There are already a <a href="http://bitbucket.org/josephwright/siunitx/issues?status=new&amp;status=open&amp;milestone=v2.2">few issues on the list for v2.2</a>, but that may alter if there is a good case made for something else. Of course, I'll also have to avoid breaking anything!
