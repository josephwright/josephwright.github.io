I'm making a start on the next release of <a title="A comprehensive (SI) units package" href="http://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx">siunitx</a>: v2.3. There are a number of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/josephwright/siunitx/issues?milestone=v2.3">issues in the database</a> targeting this release, and these are mainly about dealing with things behind the scenes. Some options need revision, and I need to improve the table code somewhat. However, I doubt that there will be much to excite users. That's not necessarily a bad thing: there seem to be a lot of siunitx users, and I don't want to break the code! Of course, if there is a particular issue that needs addressing then the usual rule applies: <a href="mailto:joseph.wright@morningstar2.co.uk">make a case to me</a> and I'll see what I can do.
