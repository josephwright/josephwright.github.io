I'm making a start on the next release of [`siunitx`](https://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx): v2.3. There are a number of [issues in the database](https://github.com/josephwright/siunitx/issues?milestone=v2.3) targeting this release, and these are mainly about dealing with things behind the scenes. Some options need revision, and I need to improve the table code somewhat. However, I doubt that there will be much to excite users. That's not necessarily a bad thing: there seem to be a lot of `siunitx` users, and I don't want to break the code! Of course, if there is a particular issue that needs addressing then the usual rule applies: [make a case to me](mailto:joseph.wright@morningstar2.co.uk) and I'll see what I can do.
