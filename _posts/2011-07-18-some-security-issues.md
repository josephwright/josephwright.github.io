This morning I had a very worrying set of e-mails from Google about the security of the blog. I'm working on sorting it out at the moment: you'll see the site alter pretty quickly as I get the hang or restoring SQL data. The posts themselves and comments should all be sorted, but I still need to fix the categories and so forth.
