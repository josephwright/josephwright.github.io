Progress on <a title="LuaTeX Homepage" href="http://www.luatex.org/">LuaTeX</a> continues at an impressive pace. On the <a title="LuaTeX Mailing List" href="http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/luatex">mailing list</a> today I see that version 0.35.0 is available as a snapshot. The list of changes is, as you'd expect at this stage, quite technical and low level.  Things are cetainly looking interesting, though.
