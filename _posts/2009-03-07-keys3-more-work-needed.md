A while ago, I did a bit of work on converting the pgfkeys package (part of <a title="Create PostScript and PDF graphics in TeX" href="http://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf">pgf</a>) to <a title="LaTeX3 Homepage" href="http://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html">LaTeX3</a> syntax, and called the result keys3. Some things have changed in LaTeX3 since then, and I also have an outstanding list of things to think about adding to keys3. On top of that, I've spotted at least one bug (inherited from pgfkeys!). So the question is: is it worth fixing them? At the moment, keys3 might not go anywhere, so I'm not sure. Thoughts, anyone?
