A while ago, I did a bit of work on converting the `pgfkeys` package (part of [`pgf`](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgf)) to [LaTeX3](https://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html) syntax, and called the result `keys3`. Some things have changed in LaTeX3 since then, and I also have an outstanding list of things to think about adding to keys3. On top of that, I've spotted at least one bug (inherited from `pgfkeys`!). So the question is: is it worth fixing them? At the moment, keys3 might not go anywhere, so I'm not sure. Thoughts, anyone?
