I had an e-mail recently pointing out that I don't say much about TeX's math mode in my blog. I guess that this is mainly because as a chemist I don't do anything particularly advanced. So things like

```latex
\begin{document}
\usepackage{fixltx2e} % \( and \) are not robust otherwise
\begin{document}
\( y = mx + c \)
\end{document}
```

are really as complex as I ever need to go!

Of course, occasionally I need to look something more complex up. I think like most people I tend to reach for the excellent [_Math Mode_](http://mirror.ctan.org/info/math/voss/mathmode/Mathmode.pdf) by Herbert Voß. The basic advice I tend to remember is to load the `amsmath` package, as it does 'lots of clever stuff'!
