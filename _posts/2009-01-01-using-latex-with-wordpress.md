A meander around Google blog search took me to [http://sixthform.info/steve/wordpress/](http://sixthform.info/steve/wordpress/), which has some very interesting details about using LaTeX with WordPress.  I'll be looking at this myself (if nothing else, it would be cool), but it really looks useful for people running larger sites (most obviously the [LaTeX Project](https://www.latex-project.org/) itself).  I'd not seen this blog before, so I wonder if others were aware of it.
