Slightly off-topic, but I think this will be of interest to some readers. After many long years in draft, I see that [volume 4A of The Art of Computer Programming](http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0201038048) by Professor D. E. Knuth has appeared in print. The [TUG link](https://tug.org/books/index.html#taocpv4a) to this says that TUG members can get a discount even if you are not a member. Worth a look! (They seem to accept international registrations, not just US ones.)
