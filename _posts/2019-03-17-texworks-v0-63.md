Regular readers will know that I'm a fan of the light-weight
[TeXworks](https://tug.org/texworks) editor. It keeps the user interface pared
down, letting both new and experienced users focus on their input, whilst at the
same time having lots of handy features.

Steffan LÃ¶ffler has recently released [v0.63 of
TeXworks](https://github.com/TeXworks/texworks/releases/tag/release-0.6.3),
and despite the minor version change (from v0.62), there's quite a lot of
new stuff. Highlights for me are

- Basic support for BibTeX, including a new menu entry to insert citations
into sources
- More granular SyncTeX sypport, making it easier to go backward and forward
from source to PDF
- Re-written syntax highlighting, addressing some of the long-standing issues
TeXworks has had with longer sources
- Improved syntax patterns and keyword completion lists (both from me!)
