As I mentioned [a little while ago](https://www.texdev.net/2016/12/16/texdev-net-is-now-set-up-for-https/), I've moved the hosting for my blog and added https access as-standard. Doing that, I of course had to take a stab at how big a hosting package to buy. I get a steady set of hits, according to WordPress's [JetPack plugin](https://jetpack.com/) about 5000/month. So I went for a hosting package that would easily cover that.

However, it seems that somewhere there are some more visitors! I got a mail from [SiteGround](http:///www.siteground.co.uk) saying that the site's been using too much CPU time based on what I've paid for. Looking over the stats, this is not anything about my setup but is one way or another 'real' hits. I can't be sure if they are real people or spam-like bots, of course, but there's only one solution: upgrade my hosting account. Hopefully this is all transparent to readers: should mean things continue to work smoothly.
