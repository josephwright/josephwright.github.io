With v3 of [`siunitx`](https://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx) out, I am as expected
getting quite a few questions about moving from v2. In the main, this is quite
easy as there is a decent amount of compatibility code. Here, I'll pick out
a few cases where you might want some adjustments.

## Working with Overleaf

One thing that people sometimes need is to work with the latest version but
allow their input to work with the older version: that's particularly true if
you work with people using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), as it will be
some time before they update to v3. You can of course just stick to the v2
interfaces, but if you'd prefer to have v3 if possible, then you will need to
define `\qty` and `\unit` (and maybe others) conditionally. I'd recommend doing
that using
```latex
\usepackage{siunitx}
\ifdefined\qty\else
  \ifdefined\NewCommandCopy
    \NewCommandCopy\qty\SI
  \else
    \NewDocumentCommand\qty{O{}mm}{\SI[#1]{#2}{#3}}
  \fi
\fi
\ifdefined\unit\else
  \ifdefined\NewCommandCopy
    \NewCommandCopy\unit\si
  \else
    \NewDocumentCommand\unit{O{}m}{\si[#1]{#2}}
  \fi
\fi
```

That then leaves options, but almost always these should be set in the preamble,
so are a 'one shot'. You can of course add to my tests above to know which
version is in use, and set selectively.

## Working with products or complex values

For people who've been using products or complex numbers in `\SI` in v2, one
could use a similar approach to the above to 'keep' the functionality by setting
it equivalent to the new `\qtyproduct` or `\complexqty` commands: of course, if
you want _both_ then you've got to make bigger changes. For example, to retain
the ability to use products in `\SI`, you'd use
```latex
\usepackage{siunitx}
\ifdefined\qtyproduct\else
  \ifdefined\DeclareCommandCopy
    \DeclareCommandCopy\SI\qtyproduct
  \else
    \DeclareDocumentCommand\SI{O{}mm}{\qtyproduct[#1]{#2}{#3}}
  \fi
\fi
```
at the cost that the code is a bit slower than `\qty` for input without
products. Complex values would be handed the same way, just changing the command
you use as a 'replacement'.

## Using litres (liters)

In v2, `\litre` and `\liter` produced different output: that was not the best
interface decision. So in v3 they are the same, but that means of course that
you might see a change. Luckily, you can set the output you want and get the
same in both v2 and v3.
```latex
\DeclareSIUnit\litre{l}
```
