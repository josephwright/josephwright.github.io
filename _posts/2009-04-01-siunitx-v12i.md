A few minor bugs have been fixed recently in <a title="A comprehensive (SI) units package" href="http://www.ctan.org/pkg/siunitx">siunitx</a>. The <code>\SIrange</code> macro now deals with non-repeated units in a better way, and several bugs with the text mode option are now sorted out. Thanks to Jonathan Jackson and Massimo Ortolano for the bug reports.
