A while ago I talked about the <a href="http://www.texdev.net/2010/01/05/chemistry-journals-publishers-support-of-latex/">variation between different chemistry publishers in their LaTeX support</a>. Looking for something on the <a href="http://www.rsc.org/">Royal Society of Chemistry</a> site today I find that the people at <a href="http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/Journals/CP/"><em>Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics</em></a> have created an <a href="http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ReSourCe/AuthorGuidelines/ElectronicFiles/Templates/tex.asp">updated template for TeX users</a>. I'd say that is good news: remember of course that the journals are not typeset from the TeX source.
