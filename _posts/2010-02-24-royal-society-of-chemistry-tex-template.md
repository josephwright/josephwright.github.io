A while ago I talked about the [variation between different chemistry publishers in their LaTeX support](/2010/01/05/chemistry-journals-publishers-support-of-latex/). Looking for something on the [Royal Society of Chemistry](https://www.rsc.org/) site today I find that the people at [_Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics_](https://www.rsc.org/Publishing/Journals/CP/) have created an [updated template for TeX users](https://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ReSourCe/AuthorGuidelines/ElectronicFiles/Templates/tex.asp). I'd say that is good news: remember of course that the journals are not typeset from the TeX source.
