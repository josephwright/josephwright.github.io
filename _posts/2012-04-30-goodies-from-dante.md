<a href="http://www.texdev.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DANTE.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1354" title="DANTE" src="http://www.texdev.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DANTE-300x167.jpg" alt="DANTE Goodies" width="300" height="167" /></a>I <a title="Die TeXnische Komödie online" href="http://www.texdev.net/2012/04/20/die-texnische-komodie-online/">recently discovered</a> that you can read issues most of <a href="http://www.dante.de/DTK.html"><em>Die TeXnische Komödie</em></a> online. My German is good enough to get the gist of the articles, and there is some interesting stuff there. I've always meant to join <a href="http://www.dante.de/">DANTE</a>, if only to support their core CTAN server, and so this seemed like an ideal opportunity. So in the post this week I got the various goodies that they send out: I particularly like the sticker!

What's particular interesting for me is the section in <em>Die TeXnische Komödie</em> detailing the various TeX-related meet-ups that take place in Germany: there are a lot! Here in the UK, I'm pleased that <a href="http://uk.tug.org/">UK-TUG</a> manages a couple of training courses and a single speaker meeting/AGM every year. It's quite a contrast!
