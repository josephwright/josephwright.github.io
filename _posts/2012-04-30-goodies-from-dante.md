![DANTE Goodies](/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DANTE-300x167.jpg)I [recently discovered](/2012/04/20/die-texnische-komodie-online/) that you can read issues most of [_Die TeXnische Komödie_](http://www.dante.de/DTK.html) online. My German is good enough to get the gist of the articles, and there is some interesting stuff there. I've always meant to join [DANTE](http://www.dante.de/), if only to support their core CTAN server, and so this seemed like an ideal opportunity. So in the post this week I got the various goodies that they send out: I particularly like the sticker!

What's particular interesting for me is the section in _Die TeXnische Komödie_ detailing the various TeX-related meet-ups that take place in Germany: there are a lot! Here in the UK, I'm pleased that [UK-TUG](http://uk.tug.org/) manages a couple of training courses and a single speaker meeting/AGM every year. It's quite a contrast!
