 I [posted yesterday](/2011/03/21/texworks-v0-4-0/) that v0.4.0 of [TeXworks](https://tug.org/texworks) has been released: this marks a new stable branch in the code. I also pointed out that there are official [Windows](http://code.google.com/p/texworks/downloads/list) and [Ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/~texworks/+archive/stable) builds. I'm now pleased to see that there is also an [unofficial build for the Mac](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vs9qutjgtwised7/TeXworks.zip), at least for 64-bit Intel systems (like mine!). Thanks to Jjgod Jiang for doing this: I've [posted before](/2011/02/06/texworks-building-on-a-mac/) about the issues building TeXworks on the Mac. So I'm now happily using the first new Mac build for over a year.
