The deadline for inclusion in <a title="TeX Live" href="http://www.tug.org/texlive">TeX Live</a> 2009 is approaching (some time in May, I think). I've got a few things I'd like to get in, so they are keeping me busy. The updates to <a title=" 	BibTeX style for use with RSC journals" href="http://www.ctan.org/pkg/rsc">rsc</a>, <a title=" 	Support for American Chemical Society journal submissions." href="http://www.ctan.org/pkg/achemso">achemso</a> (which had a bug fix today) and <a title="Quick float definitions in LaTeX" href="http://www.ctan.org/pkg/trivfloat">trivfloat</a> should all be included, and I want to fix one thing in <a title="A comprehensive (SI) units package" href="http://www.ctan.org/pkg/siunitx">siunitx</a> and look at some <a title="Writing chemistry with style" href="http://www.ctan.org/pkg/chemstyle">chemstyle</a> issues. As well as that, there have been some things for <a title="The LaTeX3 Project" href="http://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html">LaTeX3</a> to get sorted out: it now includes a new “messages” module l3msg. So work on siunitx version 2 is currently a little delayed. Hopefully I'll get back on to that next week.
