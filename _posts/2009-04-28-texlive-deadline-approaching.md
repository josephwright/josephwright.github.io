The deadline for inclusion in [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive) 2009 is approaching (some time in May, I think). I've got a few things I'd like to get in, so they are keeping me busy. The updates to [`rsc`](https://ctan.org/pkg/rsc), [`achemso`](https://ctan.org/pkg/achemso) (which had a bug fix today) and [`trivfloat`](https://ctan.org/pkg/trivfloat) should all be included, and I want to fix one thing in [`siunitx`](https://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx) and look at some [`chemstyle`](https://ctan.org/pkg/chemstyle) issues. As well as that, there have been some things for [LaTeX3](https://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html) to get sorted out: it now includes a new “messages” module l3msg. So work on siunitx version 2 is currently a little delayed. Hopefully I'll get back on to that next week.
