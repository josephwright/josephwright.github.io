As I said earlier in the week, I've been revising my key3s package, which is an experimental keyval system in [LaTeX3](https://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html) syntax. I was initially aiming to keep things up to date with recent changes in LaTeX3, but the more I looked the more there was to do. So the new version is rather different to that of a week ago. I've dropped a number of things that I'd taken from pgfkeys (part of the [`pgf`](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgf) bundle) that, with thought, I'm not happy about. That is not to say that some things wouln't re-appear: I still want to look at some of the new stuff in the development version of pgfkeys.

I'll probably upload the package to [CTAN](https://www.ctan.org) over the weekend, but for the moment the interested can grab:

- The documentation (.pdf)
- The source file (.dtx)
- Docstrip extration file (.ins)
- Demonstration/test file (.tex)
