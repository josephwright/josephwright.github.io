As I said earlier in the week, I've been revising my key3s package, which is an experimental keyval system in <a title="LaTeX3 Homepage" href="http://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html">LaTeX3</a> syntax. I was initially aiming to keep things up to date with recent changes in LaTeX3, but the more I looked the more there was to do. So the new version is rather different to that of a week ago. I've dropped a number of things that I'd taken from pgfkeys (part of the <a title=" Create PostScript and PDF graphics in TeX" href="http://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf">pgf</a> bundle) that, with thought, I'm not happy about. That is not to say that some things wouln't re-appear: I still want to look at some of the new stuff in the development version of pgfkeys.

I'll probably upload the package to <a title="The Comprehensive TeX Archive Network" href="http://www.ctan.org/">CTAN</a> over the weekend, but for the moment the interested can grab:

<ul>
    <li>The documentation (.pdf)</li>
    <li>The source file (.dtx)</li>
    <li>Docstrip extration file (.ins)</li>
    <li>Demonstration/test file (.tex)</li>
</ul>
