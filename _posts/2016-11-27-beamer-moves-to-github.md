There are lots of places one can host development of open source code. I've used a few over the years, but in recent times have mainly focussed on [GitHub](https://github.com/). That's true not least because the LaTeX3 development code is held there. The one package I'm involved in that's to-date been elsewhere has been [`beamer`](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer): there are lots of issues in the tracker which I didn't want to lose. So for some time it's been slightly orphaned on [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/). I've now (finally) been able to migrate everything using a [very handy script](https://github.com/jeffwidman/bitbucket-issue-migration) maintained by [Jeff Widman](http://www.jeffwidman.com/blog/). I'm making final arrangements on the move, but the key is that new issues should to to [GitHub.](https://github.com/josephwright/beamer/issues)
