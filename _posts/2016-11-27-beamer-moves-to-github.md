There are lots of places one can host development of open source code. I've used a few over the years, but in recent times have mainly focussed on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. That's true not least because the LaTeX3 development code is held there. The one package I'm involved in that's to-date been elsewhere has been <a href="http://ctan.org/pkg/beamer"><code>beamer</code></a>: there are lots of issues in the tracker which I didn't want to lose. So for some time it's been slightly orphaned on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a>. I've now (finally) been able to migrate everything using a <a href="https://github.com/jeffwidman/bitbucket-issue-migration">very handy script</a> maintained by <a href="http://www.jeffwidman.com/blog/">Jeff Widman</a>. I'm making final arrangements on the move, but the key is that new issues should to to <a href="https://github.com/josephwright/beamer/issues">GitHub.</a>
