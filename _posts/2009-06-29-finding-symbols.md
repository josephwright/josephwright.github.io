Usually, finding a symbol in (La)TeX means reading through Scott Pakin's [Comprehensive Symbol List](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf). However, that can be hard if all you know is what the symbol looks like. A while ago, there was a suggestion to create some kind of system to find symbols from a drawing. [Daniel Kirsch](http://kirelabs.org/) has now taken this on and created [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/en/classify). Initial impressions are very good: the idea is great and is clearly something to keep an eye on. The system relies on being [trained](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/en/train): hopefully, a few people taking an interest will build up a good set of training data quickly.
