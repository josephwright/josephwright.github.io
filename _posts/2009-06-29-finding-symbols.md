Usually, finding a symbol in (La)TeX means reading through Scott Pakin's <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf">Comprehensive Symbol List</a>. However, that can be hard if all you know is what the symbol looks like. A while ago, there was a suggestion to create some kind of system to find symbols from a drawing. <a title="kirelabs" href="http://kirelabs.org/">Daniel Kirsch</a> has now taken this on and created <a title="Detexify - Latex Symbol Recognition" href="http://detexify.kirelabs.org/en/classify">Detexify</a>. Initial impressions are very good: the idea is great and is clearly something to keep an eye on. The system relies on being <a title="Detexify - Latex Symbol Trainer" href="http://detexify.kirelabs.org/en/train">trained</a>: hopefully, a few people taking an interest will build up a good set of training data quickly.
