> I hope to take care of the endless last-minute updates over the next
couple days, and then freeze everything, including package updates, as
of this coming Monday (Oct 12).  After that, we'll have another few days
of testing, but only critical changes will be made.  Then we'll make the
final images for the DVD, etc.

I've been using TeX Live 2009 for a while on Windows and Mac OS X, and all seems pretty good. Any last changes will be bug fixes, so I'd say all looks good. Time to get those last-minute items to CTAN to make the DVD!
