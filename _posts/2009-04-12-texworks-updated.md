The <a title="TeXworks: lowering the entry barrier to the TeX world" href="http://www.texworks.org">TeXworks</a> program has had a few bug fixes recently, for example to get spell-checking and syntax highlighting to work together properly. For Linux users, compiling from the source is the best way to get a current build.  For those of use on Windows, Alain Delmoitte is very kindly providing <a title="Welcome to TeXworks (La)TeXing " href="http://www.leliseron.org/texworks">public builds</a> now and then: he has updated his build to build 291. Alain is also working on a manual (in French and English) for TeXworks, available from the same site.
