A few months ago, Javier Bezos offered to take over dealing with babel maintenance. He's been working on getting things in order, and collecting up bug reports, and has now set up a [page for development news](http://www.tex-tipografia.com/babel_news.html). Javier has included a road map of what he's hoping to do, all of which looks very sensible to me. I particularly welcome the idea that he's going to stick to the core part of babel (the mechanisms), with each language viewed as a module to be maintained by someone knowledgeable. One of the issues babel has faced is that it's simply not realistic to handle all of that in one place. It's great that he's putting the effort in.
