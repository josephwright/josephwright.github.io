<a href="http://tug.org/tug2015">TUG2015</a> takes place next week in Darmstadt, and as it's the first time I've been able to go to a TUG meeting I'm really looking forward to it. The <a href="http://tug.org/tug2015/program.html">programme</a> and participant list both look excellent and it will be good to meet several people in person who I've only known to date by e-mail. I've managed to end up with <em>three</em> talks to give, so I'm hard at work getting them ready (and hoping I can get something in writing for <a href="http://tug.org/tugboat"><em>TUGboat</em></a> too!). As well as the formal business, there will be lot so chances to chat, not least with several other people on the <a href="http://www.latex-project.org">LaTeX team</a>.
