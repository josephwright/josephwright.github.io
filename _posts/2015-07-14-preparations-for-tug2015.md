[TUG2015](https://tug.org/tug2015) takes place next week in Darmstadt, and as it's the first time I've been able to go to a TUG meeting I'm really looking forward to it. The [programme](https://tug.org/tug2015/program.html) and participant list both look excellent and it will be good to meet several people in person who I've only known to date by e-mail. I've managed to end up with _three_ talks to give, so I'm hard at work getting them ready (and hoping I can get something in writing for [_TUGboat_](https://tug.org/tugboat) too!). As well as the formal business, there will be lot so chances to chat, not least with several other people on the [LaTeX team](https://www.latex-project.org).
