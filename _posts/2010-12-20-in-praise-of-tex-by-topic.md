I've been hard at work on various [LaTeX3](https://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html) questions (more on which in another post), and little things about TeX come up all of the time. These are often rather technical, and so what I need is a good reference work which includes all of the detail. Now, _The TeXbook_ is an obvious place to look, but it's not available electronically. I do a lot of my coding when on the move (on the train, at work, various places around the house), and so carrying a book about is not always so easy. There's also a lot more to _The TeXbook_ than just a reference work, which doesn't always make it quite so easy to quickly look up a particular primitive.

On the other hand, [_TeX by Topic_](http://www.eijkhout.net/tbt/) is available electronically (and for free), and is a focussed reference work. As well as being able to download it from the author's website,Â  it's probably installed with your TeX system:

```bash
texdoc texbytopic
```

at the command line should open it up. I always find the content in _TeX by Topic_ to be excellent: enough to help me out, but not too much that I get lost. For a TeX programmer, I think there is no better resource for those fiddly questions. Being available for free is of course an added bonus, although I would strongly encourage making a contribution to the author (I certainly have). For those people who want a printed copy, _TeX by Topic_ is out of print but is [available from Lulu](http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/tex-by-topic/3109468). So all round it's an excellent choice: great work!
