I've been hard at work on various <a title="The LaTeX3 project" href="http://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html">LaTeX3</a> questions (more on which in another post), and little things about TeX come up all of the time. These are often rather technical, and so what I need is a good reference work which includes all of the detail. Now, <em>The TeXbook</em> is an obvious place to look, but it's not available electronically. I do a lot of my coding when on the move (on the train, at work, various places around the house), and so carrying a book about is not always so easy. There's also a lot more to <em>The TeXbook</em> than just a reference work, which doesn't always make it quite so easy to quickly look up a particular primitive.

On the other hand, <em><a title="TeX by Topic" href="http://www.eijkhout.net/tbt/">TeX by Topic</a></em> is available electronically (and for free), and is a focussed reference work. As well as being able to download it from the author's website,Â  it's probably installed with your TeX system:
<pre>texdoc texbytopic</pre>
at the command line should open it up. I always find the content in <em>TeX by Topic</em> to be excellent: enough to help me out, but not too much that I get lost. For a TeX programmer, I think there is no better resource for those fiddly questions. Being available for free is of course an added bonus, although I would strongly encourage making a contribution to the author (I certainly have). For those people who want a printed copy, <em>TeX by Topic</em> is out of print but is <a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/tex-by-topic/3109468">available from Lulu</a>. So all round it's an excellent choice: great work!
