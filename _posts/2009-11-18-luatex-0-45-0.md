I see from the [LuaTeX mailing](http://www.tug.org/mailman/listinfo/luatex) list that version 0.45.0 has been released. There is the usual long list of new things and bug fixes, but some that caught my eye:

- `\input` and `\openin` now accept braced filenames;
- The new primitives `\aligntab` and `\alignmark` are aliases for the use of `&amp;` and `#` in alignments;
- LuaTeX can now optionally use kpathsea to find lua `require()` files.
