We launched [learnlatex](https://learnlatex.org) to provide high-quality
teaching of core LaTeX concepts with interactive examples. From the start, we
wanted to offer the 'course' in multiple languages: this was part of the
structure from the start.

Over time, several people have done the hard work of translation to several
languages. Recently, [Daniel Zhang](https://github.com/libralibra) has
completed translations to [simplified](https://www.learnlatex.org/zh-hans/) and
[traditional](https://www.learnlatex.org/zh-hant/) Chinese. This meant working
on some technical aspects that don't come up automatically for _e.g._ western
European languages. Many thanks to Daniel for the hard work.

There are a [few
issues](https://github.com/learnlatex/learnlatex.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atranslation)
suggesting people started on other translations. It would be great if
interested (native) speakers took on the challenge of finishing for example
Japanese, Turkish and Korean translations, or started on other languages.
