For once I have a post which combines TeX directly with my job. I've just received a copy of the proofs for an article in the chemistry journal [_Dalton Transactions_](http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/Journals/DT/index.asp) (the article has DOI [10.1039/b907982c](http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b907982c)). At the top of each page I spotted

```
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf/tex/latex/techbooks/als/rsc/base2006/rsc2006v1.cls
(2004/07/27 v1.0 Standard LaTeX document class for RSC Journals)
```

The great irony is that although the journal (along with many others in chemistry) is typeset in LaTeX, they don't accept LaTeX submissions! I'd love to get hold of that class file and have a look: pretty much no chance, unfortunately.
