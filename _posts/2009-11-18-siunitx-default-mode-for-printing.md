A while ago, someone e-mailed me about [`siunitx`](https://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx) and the current choice of fonts for printing. At the moment, the package uses the current maths font for both numbers and units. It was suggested that a better standard setting would be maths font for numbers, text font for units. I'm not going to alter this for version 1, but as I work on version 2 this is something worth considering. In most documents, the difference should not show up. However, I wonder what people think: I can see the logic to the request, but don't fancy getting lots of complaints either. Comments welcome!
