This post is not directly TeX-based, but there is a link. I read the magazine PC Plus every month, and last month they had an article called _10 Mistakes every programmer makes_. It was pretty good, but one thing really caught my eye: a box entitled _Spotlight on ... the art of programming_. You can imagine my surprise to see that Professor Knuth's _The Art of Computer Programming_ did not get a mention! So I sent quick e-mail to the editors, which has turned up in the latest issue (301). That's not to say that the other suggestions were bad, but a quick Google search pops up _The Art of Computer Programming_ as hit number one, so I'd expect it to get a look-in.
