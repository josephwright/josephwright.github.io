The good people at BerliOS are now hosting the development code for `siunitx` version 2. The code is available by SVN using a web interface, or of course a proper client. Why BerliOS for hosting? They seem pretty relaxed about the [LPPL](https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/): for example, the KOMA-script bundle is also hosted there.
