The good people at [BerliOS](http://www.berlios.de) are now hosting the development code for `siunitx` version 2. The code is available by SVN using [a web interface](http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=10535), or of course a proper client. Why BerliOS for hosting? They seem pretty relaxed about the [LPPL](https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/): for example, the [KOMA-script](http://developer.berlios.de/projects/koma-script3/) bundle is also hosted there.
