<p>The idea of using 'The Cloud' for working with documents is very much on the rise. For collaborative work, particularly with less-experienced users, the idea of leaving things like version control 'built in' is very attractive. This approach is also a good way to use LaTeX on portable devices, where installing a TeX system may be tricky.</p>

<p>There are now several online services, all of which seem to offer a core set of idea (an editor, previewer and TeX system for compiling, and almost certainly version control). Keeping up with the different services is tricky: I've come across</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://spandex.io/">SpanDeX</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sharelatex.com/">ShareLaTeX</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.writelatex.com/">writeLaTeX</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.scribtex.com/">ScribTeX</a> (<a href="https://www.scribtex.com/account/new">merging with ShareLaTeX</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>All of them offer those core services, and some advertise other goodies such as DropBox integration (SpanDeX does).</p>

<p>What people want to know is probably 'which service is best'. Some of these have been round for a little while now, but none can claim a long history, so at the moment there's probably no one clear leader. Not everyone will be comfortable with an online service: letting other people store your data is not something that's risk-free, while if you want the latest version of every package you use, you're likely to need to have your own set up.</p>

<p>I'd love to hear people's experiences of these services: my colleagues don't use LaTeX, so I don't have the opportunity to test out the big 'selling points' of these sites.</p>
