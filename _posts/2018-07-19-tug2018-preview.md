The <a href="https://tug.org/tug2018/">TUG2018</a> meeting starts tomorrow in Rio de Janerio, Brazil, and the delegates have begun to collect together (many of us are staying at the Everst Rio Hotel). I'll be trying to write up notes each day to summarise the talks, discussions, <em>etc.</em>, but you'll also be able to watch live. There's also a <a href="https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/80267/tug2018">chat room on TeX StackExchange</a> dedicated to the meeting.

Informal discussions are already ongoing (the LaTeX team members have been hard at it since breakfast), so it should be a productive time.
