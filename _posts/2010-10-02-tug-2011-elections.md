I've just received the latest [_TUGBoat_](https://tug.org/TUGboat/contents.html), which contains the proceedings of the _TUG 2010 Conference_. There is lots to read there, some of which I've picked up on before from the [online videos](http://river-valley.zeeba.tv/conferences/tug-2010). I'll probably come back to some of the individual articles in other posts, but here I want to point out the TUG Election is coming up. At the back of _TUGBoat_ there's a form to nominate for the board and for the position of Chair of TUG. You've got until the 1st of February to get your form in, so there is plenty of time to decide to get involved!
