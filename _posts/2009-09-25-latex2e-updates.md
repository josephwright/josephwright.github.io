If you browse the [CTAN](https://www.ctan.org) repositories, you'll find that a number of the LaTeX core files have recently been updated. The team have had a small number of bug fixes in the code for a while, but for various reasons no release had been made. The idea is to get all of them out into the public release code, which hopefully will be done very soon (I think it actually is done, but I'm not 100% sure!).
