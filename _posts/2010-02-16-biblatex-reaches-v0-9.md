A couple of days ago <a title="Bibliographies in LaTeX using BibTeX for sorting only" href="http://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex">biblatex</a> v0.9 appeared on <a title="The Comprehensive TeX Archive Network" href="http://www.ctan.org/">CTAN</a>. As usual, there is a long list of changes, bug fixes and so on. The restrictions on inclusion in TeX distributions have been lifted, and so it's already available in <a title="TeX Live" href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live</a>. At the same time, <a title="A BibTeX replacement for users of biblatex" href="http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net/">biblatex-biber</a> has been uploaded to CTAN, so hopefully ready to use versions will be added to the distributions at some point (<a title="MikTeX" href="http://www.miktex.org/">MikTeX</a> is likely to be first, I suspect).

I've just uploaded an updated version of <a title="Chemistry styles for biblatex" href="http://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-chem">biblatex-chem</a> to CTAN, to keep in sync with the changes in biblatex. I'll try to get <a title="Biblatex support for Nature" href="http://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-nature">biblatex-nature</a> and <a title="Biblatex support for Science" href="http://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-science">biblatex-science</a> done in soon (today) so that everything is working.
