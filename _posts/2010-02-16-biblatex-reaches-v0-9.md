A couple of days ago [`biblatex`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) v0.9 appeared on [CTAN](https://www.ctan.org). As usual, there is a long list of changes, bug fixes and so on. The restrictions on inclusion in TeX distributions have been lifted, and so it's already available in [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/). At the same time, [biblatex-biber](http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net/) has been uploaded to CTAN, so hopefully ready to use versions will be added to the distributions at some point ([MikTeX](https://www.miktex.org/) is likely to be first, I suspect).

I've just uploaded an updated version of [`biblatex-chem`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-chem) to CTAN, to keep in sync with the changes in biblatex. I'll try to get [`biblatex-nature`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-nature) and [`biblatex-science`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-science) done in soon (today) so that everything is working.
