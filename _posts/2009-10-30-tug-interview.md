The [TeX Users Group](https://tug.org/) have been running a [series of interviews](https://tug.org/interviews/) for some time, with questions to prominent people in the TeX world. I've obviously been doing something right, as I've just completed [an interview for them](https://tug.org/interviews/wright.html). I do hope it's enlightening.
