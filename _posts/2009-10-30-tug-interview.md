The <a title="TeX Users Group (TUG)" href="http://www.tug.org/">TeX Users Group</a> have been running a <a title="Interview Corner" href="http://www.tug.org/interviews/">series of interviews</a> for some time, with questions to prominent people in the TeX world. I've obviously been doing something right, as I've just completed <a href="http://www.tug.org/interviews/wright.html">an interview for them</a>. I do hope it's enlightening.
