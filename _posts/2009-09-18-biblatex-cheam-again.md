Another day, another [`biblatex-chem`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-chem) update. I've added the ability to only use the first page of a range to all of the styles. Some journals require this, and I'd prefer to keep the total number of styles down with appropriate options. This is such a trivial variation it seems to be the best way to me.
