Where to start? Writing a blog on what is going in with my own (La)TeX development, and what is happening in the TeX world, seems like a handy thing to do. For my own packages (for example [`siunitx`](https://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx)) it would be nice to give an insight into what is going on with the code, and where I am currently working.  In the wider TeX world, there are things I've taken an interest in (such as [TeXworks](http://www.texworks.org/) and [LaTeX3](https://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html)) which I can make the odd comment on. There might even be some non-TeX stuff here, but I'll see (focus is the key, and all that).
