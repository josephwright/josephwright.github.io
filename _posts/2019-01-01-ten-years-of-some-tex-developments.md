Just over ten years ago, I decided to establish a blog about TeX matters.
After a bit of consideration and searching, I found that `texdev.net` was
available, and decided to call the blog [_Some TeX
Developments_](/2008/12/17/some-tex-developments/).

I've written nearly 400 posts since then, from one-liners about the blog
itself to extended 'articles' on highly-technical aspects of TeX programming.
I know that some of the most useful posts are 'user' advice, for example
[comparing TeX Live to MiKTeX](/2011/11/19/tex-on-windows-miktex-or-tex-live/),
or explaining how [overlays work in
`beamer`](/2014/01/17/the-beamer-slide-overlay-concept/).

The blog [recently moved to GitHub Pages](/2018/11/26/blog-on-the-move/),
making it a bit easier for me to run, and to fix older posts. I expect
to keep blogging, and look forward to the topics that come up in the next
ten years!
