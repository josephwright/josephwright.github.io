I've just sent a minor update of the release version of [siunitx](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/siunitx) to [CTAN](http://www.ctan.org). There was a clash with the [fourier](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fourier) package, to do with maths fonts. This is all due to the lack of an upright Î¼ in Computers Modern: a continued pain. For the moment, all is sorted again! One note: I've done the release here using [TeX Live 2009](http://www.tug.org/texlive/), rather than my more usual [MiKTeX 2.7](http://www.miktex.org/). Everything seems to have worked, but any feedback is of course welcome!
