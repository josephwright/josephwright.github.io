A while ago, a question was asked on [TeX-sx](http://tex.stackexchange.com) about [biblatex](http://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) [support for the IEEE and AIP bibliography styles](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/10936/73). I sorted out an [IEEE one](http://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-ieee) pretty quickly: it's a single style and there is a good demonstration document, so this was not too hard. However, to date I've not got the physics side of things sorted. I've now been reminded about this, and hopefully have the time available to get on with this. So now all I have to decide is which styles to got for: both the AIP and APS seem pretty obvious, but beyond that I'm not so sure.
