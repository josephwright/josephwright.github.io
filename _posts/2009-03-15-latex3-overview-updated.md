A while ago, I drafted an overview article on <a title="LaTeX3 Homepage" href="http://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html">LaTeX3</a> for <a title="The Communications of the TeX Users Group" href="http://www.tug.org/tugboat/">TUGBoat</a>. Since then, there have been some key changes to the current LaTeX3 code, and so I've slightly revised the article. It is aimed as a very general overview of what is available at the moment, and is available as a PDF and in source form.
