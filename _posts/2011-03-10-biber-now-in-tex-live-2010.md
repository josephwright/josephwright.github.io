Many readers will be familiar with the <a title="Biber: A BibTeX replacement for users of biblatex" href="http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net/">Biber</a> program, a replacement for BibTeX which works with the <a title="Programmable Bibliographies and Citations" href="http://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex">biblatex</a> package. Binaries for common platforms have been available from <a title="TLcontrib" href="http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/">TLcontrib</a> for a while, but have now been added to the main TeX Live 2010 system. So you can install Biber on the ‘common’ platforms using the TeX Live Manager (or <code>tlmgr</code> from the command line). Yet another reason to move on from BibTeX and switch to biblatex, if you've not already!
