Many readers will be familiar with the [Biber](http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net/) program, a replacement for BibTeX which works with the [`biblatex`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) package. Binaries for common platforms have been available from [TLcontrib](http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/) for a while, but have now been added to the main TeX Live 2010 system. So you can install Biber on the 'common' platforms using the TeX Live Manager (or `tlmgr` from the command line). Yet another reason to move on from BibTeX and switch to `biblatex`, if you've not already!
