[WinEdt ](http://www.winedt.com/)is a popular (La)TeX editor on Windows. A new major release, [version 6](http://www.winedt.com/winedt.html), has just appeared on the WinEdt homepage.  The interface has received a lot of attention, with new icons and menu arrangements. One thing that a lot of people have been hoping for is UTF-8 support, but the release notes say

> Avoid sending major feature requests: they will have to wait for version 6.1 (unicode, folding and all)!

So for the moment people who need UTF-8 will have to look elsewhere. Another point to note for users of version 5.5 is that this is _not_ a free upgrade (WinEdt is shareware).
