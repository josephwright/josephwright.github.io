The [`biblatex`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) package offers a lot of power in creating complex bibliographies. It also uses its own style files, separate from the 'traditional' ones used by BibTeX (`plain`, `unsrt`, _etc._). In many ways that is a good thing, as the traditional styles are rather limited. However, lots of people rely on the traditional styles, so emulating them would be useful. There's an [open question on the TeX-sx site](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/58152/73) asking how to do this: it's very much a 'marker', as the person who asked is one of the `biblatex` experts! [Marco Daniel](https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/5239/marco-daniel) has now taken up the challenge, with a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/marcodaniel/trad-biblatex) set up for development of a set of styles. They are still a work in progress, but it looks like the question will soon have an answer!
