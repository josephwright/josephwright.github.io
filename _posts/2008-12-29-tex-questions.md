There are three main places to ask (La)TeX-related questions in English:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/topics">comp.text.tex</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/texhax">texhax mailing list</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://latex-community.org/">LaTeX Community forums</a></li>
</ul>
Each has a different mix of people, and I wonder how much cross-over there is. The LaTeX Community forums seem best for the newer user, as there is a lot less complex information than in the newgroup or on texhax. I'd say that the newgroup is the most active of the three, with texhax a relativity quite list. Of course, there are also <a href="http://wiki.contextgarden.net/ConTeXt_Mailing_Lists">ConTeXt-specific places</a> to talk. I wonder how much regulars of each “place” know about the other ones?
