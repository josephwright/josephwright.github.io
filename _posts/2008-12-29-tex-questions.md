There are three main places to ask (La)TeX-related questions in English:

- [comp.text.tex](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/topics)
- [texhax mailing list](https://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/texhax)
- [LaTeX Community forums](http://latex-community.org/)

Each has a different mix of people, and I wonder how much cross-over there is. The LaTeX Community forums seem best for the newer user, as there is a lot less complex information than in the newgroup or on texhax. I'd say that the newgroup is the most active of the three, with texhax a relativity quite list. Of course, there are also [ConTeXt-specific places](http://wiki.contextgarden.net/ConTeXt_Mailing_Lists) to talk. I wonder how much regulars of each “place” know about the other ones?
