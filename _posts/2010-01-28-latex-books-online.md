I was looking something up today, and quite by accident found that [Safari Books Online](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/) has both the [_Guide to LaTeX_](http://www.pearsoned.co.uk/Bookshop/detail.asp?item=100000000037792) and [_The LaTeX Companion_](http://www.pearsoned.co.uk/Bookshop/detail.asp?item=162589) available. Unfortunately, the [subscription costs](https://ssl.safaribooksonline.com/subscribe) mean that for individuals the price is far too high, compared to buying the printed versions. However, I also found that my employers ([UEA](http://www.uea.ac.uk/)) have paid for access to a range of books via the service. So if you are in a university it might be worth seeing if you can get the books as part of your institution's more general access policies.
