I was looking something up today, and quite by accident found that <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/">Safari Books Online</a> has both the <a href="http://www.pearsoned.co.uk/Bookshop/detail.asp?item=100000000037792"><em>Guide to LaTeX</em></a> and <a href="http://www.pearsoned.co.uk/Bookshop/detail.asp?item=162589"><em>The LaTeX Companion</em></a> available. Unfortunately, the <a href="https://ssl.safaribooksonline.com/subscribe">subscription costs</a> mean that for individuals the price is far too high, compared to buying the printed versions. However, I also found that my employers (<a title="The University of East Anglia" href="http://www.uea.ac.uk/">UEA</a>) have paid for access to a range of books via the service. So if you are in a university it might be worth seeing if you can get the books as part of your institution's more general access policies.
