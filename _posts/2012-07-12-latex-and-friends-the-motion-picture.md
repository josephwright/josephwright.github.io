Earlier in the year, a new guide to LaTeX was published: <a title="LaTeX and Friends" href="http://www.springer.com/computer/media+design/book/978-3-642-23815-4"><em>LaTeX and Friends</em></a> by <a title="Marc van Dongen" href="http://csweb.ucc.ie/~dongen/">Marc van Dongen</a>. I think the book is pretty good: I wrote a preface for it! Marc has now produced a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s04nZHtI8jg">short video</a> promoting the book itself but also LaTeX more generally. The first five or so minutes concentrate on LaTeX, then the rest of the video moves on to how his book highlights particular areas. It's certainly worth taking a look, not only for the content but also as the video itself is very well produced.
