Usually, I keep my day job (as a university lecturer in chemistry) and my LaTeX
work  separate. Of course, I use LaTeX at work for things like lecture handouts,
but most of the time the two areas don't directly intersect.

So it was quite interesting to be talking yesterday at a chemistry conference
(the ACS Fall 2021 Meeting) about [`siunitx`](https://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx). I'd
been invited by [Stuart
Chalk](https://www.unf.edu/coas/chemistry/faculty/Stuart_Chalk.aspx) to a
session on units and data reuse: much more like metrology/computer science than
my usual day-to-day wet chemistry!

It was good to see that many of the things I do in `siunitx` fit into wider
efforts by people who do day-to-day work on units. The idea of logical mark-up
for unit input, the ability to decompose units into parts and the realities of
less-than-ideal input from users were all there. Hopefully, `siunitx` will help
with the work being done by groups such as [DRUM (Digital Representation of
Units of Measure)](https://codata.org/initiatives/task-groups/drum/) to make
information more computer-readable. I'll also be looking at
[QUDT](http://www.qudt.org/) for inspiration about the real technical detail
of the myriad of units in real use.

I also managed to get in a few comments about some LaTeX work that's important
for data reuse more widely: tagged PDFs and [`tex4ht`](https://tug.org/tex4ht/).
So it was a pretty productive use of an evening!
