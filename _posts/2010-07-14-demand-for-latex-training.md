As part of my activities with the [UK TeX Users' Group](http://uk.tug.org/), I'm helping to set up and run a LaTeX training course at the end of the month. Unlike other courses I've seen in the UK, we are running this one as ‘open to all’ for a pretty nominal fee. What's surprised me is that it has proved to be very popular indeed. We had 25 places, and they were all used up some time ago. My list of people who are interested in another similar course has now reached 29 names, which probably means that we can fill a second course without any more effort at all! I hope that we'll be able to do a second course at some stage in the autumn: as you might imagine the problem is availability of time for people to actually do it. Of course, I'm happy to hear about anyone else interested in registering, as I'll add them to the list for the second course and any others that end up being run. New LaTeX users are a good thing, and so I'm keen to train as many people as show an interest.
