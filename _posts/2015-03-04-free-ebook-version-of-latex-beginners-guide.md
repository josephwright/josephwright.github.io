For today only you can get a free eBook copy of Stefan Kottwitz's _LaTeX Beginner's Guide_ [from the publisher](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning). I [reviewed the book](/2011/04/05/latex-beginner%E2%80%99s-guide-published/) when it first came out, and there is also more detail over at [The LaTeX Community](https://latex.org/forum/).
