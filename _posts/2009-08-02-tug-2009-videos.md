For those of us who couldn't make <a title="TUG 2009" href="http://www.tug.org/tug2009/">TUG 2009</a>, the excellent people at <a title="River Valley Technologies" href="http://river-valley.com/">River Valley Technologies</a> have <a title="TUG 2009 | River Valley TV" href="http://zeeba.tv/conferences/text/tex/tug2009/">recorded the talks</a>. They are appearing a few at a time, and to quote the site:

<blockquote>Talks will be uploaded as post-processing is completed. Please note that we had some technical problems on day 1, so they may take longer to prepare.</blockquote>

I'm sure we can wait a little while for them to appear: I'll certainly be taking a look over the next few days at what's on offer.
