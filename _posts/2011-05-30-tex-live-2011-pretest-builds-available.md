Now that <a href="http://www.texdev.net/2011/05/27/tex-live-2010-freeze-2/">TeX Live 2010</a> is frozen, work has started on <a href="http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html">test builds for TeX Live 2011</a>.Â  This is really part of a continuing evolution, and so there are (so far) no big surprises for me. Everything installed smoothly on my Mac, and I'll be updating my PC tomorrow if I have a chance. I do hope other people are getting on with downloading the test code!

(For those people who, like me, are <a href="http://www.texworks.org/">TeXworks</a> fans, I notice that TeXworks v0.4.1 is included in the Mac version of TeX Live 2011 and so presumably in the Windows version too. Great work by everyone who helped getting it to build successfully on the Mac, and of course everywhere else!)
