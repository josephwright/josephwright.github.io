Jonathan Kew has posted that he has switched the version number of <a title="Lowering the entry barrier to the TeX world" href="http://www.texworks.org">TeXworks</a> to v0.2, and has made a branch to keep things stable. There are new binaries for Windows and Mac users: Linux people still have to compile things themselves. The idea is that the branch will just get bug fixes, keeping the code stable enough for a wider range of users. Of course, those people who want the latest features will have to stick with the trunk. I've not seen any problems with the trunk so far, but I guess that some of the upcoming changes (for example, adding scripting) have some risk of problems.
