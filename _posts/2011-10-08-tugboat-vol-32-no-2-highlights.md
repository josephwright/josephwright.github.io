The regular arrival of <em><a href="http://tug.org/tugboat">TUGBoat</a></em> is always welcome, and a chance for an interesting read. Everyone will have their favourite entry, but I thought I'd pick out one or two highlights.

Hans Hagen writes <a href="https://www.tug.org/members/TUGboat/tb32-2/tb101hagen.pdf">about creating e-books</a> using <a href="http://wiki.contextgarden.net">ConTeXt</a>. Now, there is a lot of very good information in the article about the problems at hand. However, what makes it a highlight for me is the take he has on the e-book concept. There are a lot of very good points about the limits of an electronic book: for example, drop a book and it will be fine, drop an e-book â€¦

Another highlight for me is not an original article but <a href="http://tug.org/TUGboat/tb32-2/tb101shaw.pdf">a reprint</a>. Now reprints on TeX topics are not unusual, but in this case they've looked a bit wider and included one from <a href="http://www.printmag.com"><em>Print</em></a>, a magazine dedicated to visual design. Looking at books as design objects, rather than as something to code, is a refreshing change (at least for me)!

The third highlight for me is not a single article, but a set of book reviews. Boris Veytsman has taken on the task of co-ordinating (and often writing) reviews, and the current <em>TUGBoat</em> includes four. Hopefully this will be a regular feature, and help keep us all up to date with what's going on in print for both TeX users and the wider world.
