<p>Javier Bezos has <a href="http://www.tex-tipografia.com/babel_news.html">just announced</a> that he's looking for people to beta-test the next version of <code>babel</code>. Javier has been working hard on getting the <code>babel</code> code organised, and working out what problems need addressing, after quite a long 'drift' period. I hope lots of interested users pop up!</p>
