Javier Bezos has [just announced](http://www.tex-tipografia.com/babel_news.html) that he's looking for people to beta-test the next version of `babel`. Javier has been working hard on getting the `babel` code organised, and working out what problems need addressing, after quite a long 'drift' period. I hope lots of interested users pop up!
