Browsing the [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive) site today, I see that TeX Live 2013 has been released. There are as usual a few [changes to note](https://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#news). My highlights:

- XeTeX now uses the [HarfBuzz](http://harfbuzz.org) shaper rather than the older ICU engine (which is no longer being developed): see my [earlier post](/2013/03/12/xetex-0-9999-moving-to-harfbuzz-and-lots-of-other-goodies/) about this change
- LuaTeX is updated to Lua 5.2 (the latest Lua release)
- `Microtype` now supports protrusion in XeTeX and LuaTeX

I've been using the pretest version of TeX Live for a while, and am very happy that all seems to be working just fine. Of course, many people will want the DVD version, which will be a while, but for the downloaders you can grab it now.
