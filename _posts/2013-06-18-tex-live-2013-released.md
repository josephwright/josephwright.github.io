<p>Browsing the <a href="http://tug.org/texlive">TeX Live</a> site today, I see that TeX Live 2013 has been released. There are as usual a few <a href="http://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#news">changes to note</a>. My highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>XeTeX now uses the <a href="http://harfbuzz.org">HarfBuzz</a> shaper rather than the older ICU engine (which is no longer being developed): see my <a href="http://www.texdev.net/2013/03/12/xetex-0-9999-moving-to-harfbuzz-and-lots-of-other-goodies/">earlier post</a> about this change</li>
<li>LuaTeX is updated to Lua 5.2 (the latest Lua release)</li>
<li><code>Microtype</code> now supports protrusion in XeTeX and LuaTeX</li>
</ul>

<p>I've been using the pretest version of TeX Live for a while, and am very happy that all seems to be working just fine. Of course, many people will want the DVD version, which will be a while, but for the downloaders you can grab it now.</p>
