Following up on the [recent first beta]() for
[`siunitx`](https://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx), I've now made a [second beta
available](/uploads/2021/04/16/siunitx-v3.0.0-beta-2.tds.zip). There was only
one issue picked up so far by testers, plus of course those I've spotted myself.
In particular, I've allowed a way to set the text font manually if simply
resetting back to the standard one doesn't work. I've also sneaked in a late
addition: the ability to parse and print uncertainties the way NIST seem to
suggest they should appear.

Assuming that I get no major issues coming up, I plan to put this out as the
first v3 release in a couple of weeks time: before the next LaTeX kernel update!
