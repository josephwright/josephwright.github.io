TeX and LaTeX continue to attract attention, as you can see from the [list of TeX-related blogs](http://www.texample.net/community/) on [TeXample.net](http://www.texample.net/). I don't know how many hits each of those sites get, but I do know how popular my blog is and have some idea about a few other places. So I thought it might be worth a quick look at the numbers.

In a typical day, ‘Some TeX Developments’ gets around 200 hits. That varies a bit, depending on whether I post something. There are also occasional spikes, with the [CV mini-series](/2011/11/05/writing-a-curriculum-vitae-in-latex-part-1/) getting me over 500 hits a day for four days, and [my thoughts on a LaTeX3 roadmap](/2011/09/05/latex3-roadmap/) attracting over 2000 hits that day! By way of comparison, the [TeX.sx community blog](http://tex.blogoverflow.com/) gets around 100 hits per day when there is not a post, rising to 300 to 400 on days when a post is added. The [UK-TUG website](http://uk.tug.org/) gets around 60 hits per day, mainly for the templates. (It's not really a blog, although we do use it for announcements.)

The [TeXample.net](http://www.texample.net/) site features both the community aggregator and the very useful [set of Ti<i>k</i>Z examples](http://www.texample.net/tikz/). As you'd expect, this combination gains it a lot more hits than a blog: I believe about 2500 per day.

Then there's [TeX.sx](https://tex.stackexchange.com/), which has grown rapidly in the last year to become a great place to find TeX answers. Hits-per-day have been rising steadily there, and are now well over 20,000 per day. There are usually at lest 40 new questions and 70 new answers driving this growth, which I think bodes well for TeX.

So over all the picture is of a range of sites getting a good number of hits. I've no idea how that compares with other typesetting systems or programming languages, but I'd like to feel it is a good sign for the future.
