Progress toward the next stepping stone in the [TeXworks](https://tug.org/texworks/) schedule, release 0.4, is ongoing. To help get the new code tested for this, an experimental build has been added to the [download page](http://code.google.com/p/texworks/downloads/list) for users on Windows. For people on Linux, it's usually possible to build the program from the source without too much hassle, so they can hep to test out too.
