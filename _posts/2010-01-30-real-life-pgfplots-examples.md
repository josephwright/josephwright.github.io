I've just sent a draft to <a title="The Communications of the TeX Users Group" href="http://www.tug.org/tugboat/">TUGBoat</a> for an article about <a title="Create normal/logarithmic plots in two and three dimensions for LaTeX/TeX/ConTeXt" href="http://tug.ctan.org/pkg/pgfplots">pgfplots</a>. As many readers will know, pgfplots is built on <a title="Create PostScript and PDF graphics in TeX" href="http://tug.ctan.org/pkg/pgf">pgf/Tikz</a>, which means that it can be used for both DVI and PDF output, and with plain TeX, LaTeX and ConTeXt. In my draft, I've used some real life plots (from a couple of recent publications in the research group I work in). The draft will probably change a bit, but for a preview take a look a the <a href="http://www.texdev.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/pgfplots.pdf">the PDF</a>.
