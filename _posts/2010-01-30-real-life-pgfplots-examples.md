I've just sent a draft to [TUGBoat](https://tug.org/tugboat/) for an article about [`pgfplots`](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgfplots). As many readers will know, pgfplots is built on [pgf/Tikz](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgf), which means that it can be used for both DVI and PDF output, and with plain TeX, LaTeX and ConTeXt. In my draft, I've used some real life plots (from a couple of recent publications in the research group I work in). The draft will probably change a bit, but for a preview take a look a the [the PDF](/uploads/2010/01/pgfplots.pdf).
