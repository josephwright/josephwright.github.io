Today sees the release of [TeX Live 2011](http://www.tug.org/texlive/). As most readers will know, TeX Live is a cross-platform TeX system, and is the basis of the MacTeX distribution for Mac OS X. TeX Live 2011 is very much evolutionary, with only a [small list of changes](http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#news) from earlier releases. Perhaps the most notable is that the [Biber](http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net/) program is now available for major platforms: it was added to the on-line updates for TeX Live 2010, but this will be the first appearance on the DVD version. I guess that Karl Berrry will now be busy catching up on [CTAN](https://www.ctan.org) updates, so that on-line updating of TeX Live can resume.
