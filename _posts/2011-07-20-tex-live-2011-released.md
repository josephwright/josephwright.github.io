Today sees the release of <a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live 2011</a>. As most readers will know, TeX Live is a cross-platform TeX system, and is the basis of the MacTeX distribution for Mac OS X. TeX Live 2011 is very much evolutionary, with only a <a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#news">small list of changes</a> from earlier releases. Perhaps the most notable is that the <a href="http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net/">Biber </a>program is now available for major platforms: it was added to the on-line updates for TeX Live 2010, but this will be the first appearance on the DVD version. I guess that Karl Berrry will now be busy catching up on <a href="http://www.ctan.org">CTAN </a>updates, so that on-line updating of TeX Live can resume.
