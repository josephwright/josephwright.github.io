I've just uploaded a first attempt at [`biblatex-phys`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-phys) to [CTAN](https://ctan.org/): give it a day or so to be mirrored around the world or pick it up from the [BitBucket development site](https://github.com/josephwright/biblatex-phys). I've based the style on [REVTeX](http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/revtex), which seems to show that the AIP and APS use more-or-less the same style with a few tiny variations. So I've provided one style and used some options to control the output. I'm sure there will be a few rough edges, so at the moment I've set the version as 0.9, meaning that there may well be adjustments before a truly usable release. However, I'd hope people pick this up and test it: that's the only way to improve it!
