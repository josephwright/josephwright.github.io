Progress on `siunitx` version 2has not been as fast as I'd like.  There are a few reasons.  First, my 'TeX time' has been squeezed since the start of the year as I'm doing a couple of [Open University](http://www.open.ac.uk) courses.  Some of the 'TeX time' I do have has also been taken up with jobs for [UK-TUG](http://uk.tug.org/), mainly the website and membership renewals.  Finally, when I looked at the wish-list for version 2 it turned out to be rather more complex than I'd remembered!

The net result is that I need to revise my initial timetable.  I'm still aiming for release before the end of the year, so I'd like to get a testing version finished by early autumn (late September or early October). My key aim is to get some internal structures improved, so that I can build new features over time (even if not everything makes version 2.0).
