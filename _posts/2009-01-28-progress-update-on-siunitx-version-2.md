Progress on<a title="siunitx version 2" href="http://siunitx.berlios.de"> siunitx version 2</a> has not been as fast as I'd like.  There are a few reasons.  First, my “TeX time” has been squeezed since the start of the year as I'm doind a couple of <a title="Open University" href="http://www.open.ac.uk">Open University</a> courses.  Some of the “TeX time” I do have has also been taken up with jobs for <a title="UK TeX Users' Group" href="http://uk.tug.org/">UK-TUG</a>, mainly the website and membership renewals.  Finally, when I looked at the wish-list for version 2 it turned out to be rather more complex than I'd remembered!

The net result is that I need to revise my initial timetable.  I'm still aiming for release before the end of the year, so I'd like to get a testing version finished by early autumn (late September or early October). My key aim is to get some internal structures improved, so that I can build new features over time (even if not everything makes version 2.0).
