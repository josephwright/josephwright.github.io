Reading through some TeX-related material today, I spotted that the very popular [biblatex](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) package has finally reached version 1. Accompanying this release is a version step for the [biber](http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net/) BibTeX-replacement program, which reaches version 0.6. Both are now considered non-beta, and the biblatex release in particular is a big story to me. I'll be checking on my own biblatex-related packages over the weekend and making sure that they are working with the new release, and if all goes well will move them to v1.0 as well.

A quick look through the documentation for both biblatex and biber shows that the new versions are mainly about stability. There are not a lot of changes listed from the previous testing releases: they've proved to be pretty stable and so the time for an official move to release status has obviously arrived.
