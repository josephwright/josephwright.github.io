The [TeXworks](https://tug.org/texworks) program has been my main TeX editor for some time, despite having version number '0.0.0'. There are recently been some work on getting a proper icon sorted out for the program, to replace the place holder. At the same time, Jonathan Kew has moved the version number on to 0.1.  Great stuff: I'd already say it's very usable. There is a [Windows build](http://www.leliseron.org/texworks) for the latest version curtsey of Alain Delmotte: I suspect Mac and Unix users will have a little longer to wait if they want something pre-compiled.
