A quick post which follows on from my [earlier mention](/2011/02/10/quicklatex-a-latex-plugin-for-wordpress/) of [QuickLaTeX](http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/quicklatex/). What I did not say was that as well as letting me use LaTeX in my posts, it also lets everyone use it in their comments. All you need to do is to put `![latexpage]` at the start of your comment, and QuickLaTeX will then parse it and insert the relevant graphics. See for example [my own use of this feature in a comment](/2011/03/20/sorting-issues-for-consideration-for-siunitx-v2-2/#comments) earlier today.
