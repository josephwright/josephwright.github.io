Jonathan Kew has produced <a title="Download TeXworks" href="http://code.google.com/p/texworks/downloads/list">new binaries</a> for <a title="TeXworks - lowering the entry barrier to the TeX world" href="http://www.texworks.org">TeXworks</a> for both both Windows and MacOS X. The ZIP file now contains everything you need to download in one place, which makes installation that bit easier.

On a somewhat related matter, I see that <a title="MiKTeX Project Page" href="http://www.miktex.org/">MiKTeX</a> 2.8 is going to include TeXworks, including setting up file associations (.tex and .sty). As <a title="TeX Live" href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live 2009</a> is also coming with TeXworks, getting hold of the programme should become very easy for end users. This can only be a good thing.
