Jonathan Kew has produced [new binaries](http://code.google.com/p/texworks/downloads/list) for [TeXworks](http://www.texworks.org) for both both Windows and MacOS X. The ZIP file now contains everything you need to download in one place, which makes installation that bit easier.

On a somewhat related matter, I see that [MiKTeX](https://www.miktex.org/) 2.8 is going to include TeXworks, including setting up file associations (.tex and .sty). As [TeX Live 2009](https://tug.org/texlive/) is also coming with TeXworks, getting hold of the programme should become very easy for end users. This can only be a good thing.
