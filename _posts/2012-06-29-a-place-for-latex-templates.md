Templates for LaTeX documents are always in demand, but finding them is not always so easy. There's now a place find them: <a href="http://www.latextemplates.com">LaTeX Templates</a>. A quick look around the new site gives a good impression: well organised, easy to follow and good looking.Â  Of course, producing good templates is not easy (we have a few on the <a href="http://uk.tug.org/category/templates/">UK-TUG site</a> too), so if you have a good suggestion I'd <a href="http://www.latextemplates.com/submit">send it in</a>!
