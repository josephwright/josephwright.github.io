Templates for LaTeX documents are always in demand, but finding them is not always so easy. There's now a place find them: [LaTeX Templates](https://www.latextemplates.com). A quick look around the new site gives a good impression: well organised, easy to follow and good looking.  Of course, producing good templates is not easy (we have a few on the UK-TUG site too), so if you have a good suggestion I'd [send it in](https://www.latextemplates.com/submit)!
