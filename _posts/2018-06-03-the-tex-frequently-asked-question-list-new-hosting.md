The <a href="http://texfaq.org">TeX Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) List</a> has been a fixture of the TeX world for many years. It started out as a regular column in the (now dormant) <a href="http://uk.tug.org">UK-TUG</a> journal <em>Baskerville</em>, before being taken up as an essentially one-person project by Robin Fairbairns.

Since Robin's retirement, the FAQ have remained available online but essentially maintenance has been 'in hibernation'. That's largely because the structure of the sources was tricky: they were designed to be typeset and to give HTML output following scripted conversion. For the 'new' team (currently <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/1090/david-carlisle">David Carlisle</a>, <a href="http://texblog.net/">Stefan Kottwitz</a>, <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/63279/karl-berry">Karl Berry</a> and me) looking after the material, that's been tricky as we are not editing the sources directly on the server (Robin's old set up).

To keep the FAQ up-to-date and easy-to-maintain, the sources have been converted to Markdown to allow them to be used in a <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> set up. The traditional <a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk">http://www.tex.ac.uk</a> website now redirects to <a href="http://texfaq.org"><code>texfaq.org</code></a>, which will be the canonical site address. You can also go 'directly' to the GitHub Pages site, <a href="https://texfaq.github.io"><code>texfaq.github.io</code></a>. (There are a few final adjustments to make, so at the moment you might get redirected from <code>texfaq.org</code> to <code>texfaq.github.io</code>.)

The aim remains to have a curated set of FAQ, not growing too big and staying authoritative. Of course, the core team appreciate help making that the case: you can <a href="https://github.com/texfaq/texfaq.github.io">access the material on GitHub</a> to log issues or make suggestions for change.
