After a bit of an interruption in service, the great [`texdoc.net`](http://texdoc.net) is back on-line. For those not familiar, it provides a web interface to the `texdoc` command from TeX Live/MiKTeX. So you can type in (or link to) a package name and see the current docs: for example [`http://texdoc.net/pkg/siunitx`](http://texdoc.net/pkg/siunitx). The updated site now has TeX Live 2018: the current release of the major TeX system for Linux (which is what the system runs). Many thanks to [Stefan Kottwitz](https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/213/stefan-kottwitz?tab=profile) for his continued work on this and [DANTE](https://www.dante.de/) for supporting the cost of running the site.
