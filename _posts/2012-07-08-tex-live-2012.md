The <a href="http://tug.org/">TeX Users Group</a> today released <a href="http://tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live 2012</a>, the TeX distribution used by many Unix and Windows users and the basis for <a href="http://tug.org/mactex/">MacTeX</a>. This year's <a href="http://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-810009.2">new features</a> are very much evolutionary, with perhaps the highlight being support for multiple repositories (thus making using <a href="http://http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/">TLContrib</a> easier to use). As always, TeX Live 2012 has been in pretest for some time, and works very nicely. (If you've been using the pretest, there is no need to reinstall.)
