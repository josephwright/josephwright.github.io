As part of my activity for <a href="http://uk.tug.org">UK-TUG</a>, I and a couple of other members ran a training event last week in London: <a href="http://uk.tug.org/2011/07/12/latex-for-beginners-course-26th-august-2011-uea-london/">LaTeX for beginners</a>. This is the third time we've run a similar course, and I think that this was the best presentation we've given to date. The <a href="https://github.com/uktug/latex-beginners-course">slides and handouts</a> seem to work pretty well, and the timing and so forth is now becoming a lot clearer!

Coming away from the event, what is most notable is the demand for LaTeX training. We've run the same course three times in just over a year, and I've currently got a waiting list which will easily fill the next presentation. At the same time, we get asked a lot about an intermediate-level course, and so we've made a start on <a href="https://github.com/uktug/latex-intermediate-course">assembling some slides for that</a>, too.

On the course itself, we had a number of people from publishing backgrounds, and again there are more on the waiting list. So it's clear that LaTeX continues to be a significant player, at least in the UK, in the publishing world.

Depending on availability of help, I'm hoping that we can run one course early in the new year, and another at around Easter. So this will be keeping me busy for a while!
