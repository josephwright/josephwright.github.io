Jonathan Kew has released a couple of bug-fix versions on the ‘stable’ 0.2 branch of [TeXworks](http://www.texworks.org), taking the current stable version to v0.2.2. The latest fix only affects Windows users, and is related to the ‘drag and drop’ inclusion of JPEG images. As usual, [pre-compiled versions](http://code.google.com/p/texworks/downloads/list) are available for Windows and Mac OS X: Linux users have to grab the source and compile their own.
