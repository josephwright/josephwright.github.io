Getting started with LaTeX is more tricky than getting started with WYSIWYG software, as there is a definite learning curve to LaTeX, and the concepts are different from those in (perhaps more familiar) word processors. Good guides are therefore very important, and writing them is not easy. <a href="http://theoval.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~nlct/">Nicola Talbot</a> has maintained one of those guides for many years, along with a lot of other useful (La)TeX advice. She's now branched out into the <a href="http://www.dickimaw-books.com">world of publishing</a>, and has <a href="http://www.dickimaw-books.com/latex/novices/">updated her guide for novice LaTeX users</a> as part of that. Nicola's making it available as a 'proper' book, but you can also get it for printing out at home, as an 'online PDF' or in HTML format. The source is there too, so if you really want you can typeset the entire thing!
