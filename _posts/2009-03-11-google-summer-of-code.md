The [TeX Users' Group](http://www.tug.org/) (TUG) is applying (for the second year) to be a mentoring organisation for the [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) (GSOC). Currently, the [TUG web page for the GSOC](http://www.tug.org/gsoc/) lists seven very different potential projects.  All of them look both exciting and challenging.  Hopefully, this will convince Google to approve TUG as a mentoring organisation, and will then attract keen students!
