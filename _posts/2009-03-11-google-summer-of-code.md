The <a title="The TeX Users' Group" href="http://www.tug.org/">TeX Users' Group</a> (TUG) is applying (for the second year) to be a mentoring organisation for the <a title="Google Summer of Code" href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a> (GSOC). Currently, the<a title="TUG Summer of Code page" href="http://www.tug.org/gsoc/"> TUG web page for the GSOC</a> lists seven very different potential projects.  All of them look both exciting and challenging.  Hopefully, this will convince Google to approve TUG as a mentoring organisation, and will then attract keen students!
