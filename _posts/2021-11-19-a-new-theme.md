I've been meaning for a little while to look properly at my
[Jeykll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for  the site and tidy it up: it was a bit
basic. Prompted in part by [Will Robertson](http://wspr.io/), I decided that now
is the moment.

I consulted with my favourite ---duck--- internet buddy, [Paulo
Cereda](https://twitter.com/paulocereda), and he pointed my to the rather
flexible [Hamilton theme](https://zivong.blog/jekyll-theme-hamilton/). You'll
see I'm tweaking it a bit, so there will be minor changes over time, but I think
it looks good: balances off between not being totally plain with the fact I have
zero design ability!

Paulo himself doesn't have a blog, but he's part of the excellent Island of TeX,
most famous for [arara](https://islandoftex.gitlab.io/arara/). Paulo tells me
they don't use Jekyll, but rather [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), but that
didn't stop him helping me :)
