Getting an idea of what users actually use can sometimes be tricky. To help understand how people are using <a href="http://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex"><code>biblatex</code></a>, there's a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/X2FWPNR">short survey</a> set up. In particular, we are looking for some idea of how people use <a href="http://www.texdev.net/2016/03/13/managing-biblatex-backends/">back-ends</a>: as I've mentioned before, having two of them means more 'interesting' development so it's important to get some insight into real life use.
