Lars Løge has reported a couple of errors with the <code>textmode</code> option in <a title="siunitx - A comprehensive (SI) units package" href="http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=siunitx">siunitx</a>.  One was rather harder to spot than the other, but both should be fixed in v1.2e, which has just gone to <a title="The Comprehensive TeX Archive Network" href="http://www.ctan.org">CTAN</a>.  I've also had some questions about table formatting with footnotes, but this is a “hard problem” and I'm not likely to alter the current behaviour in version 1.  It is on the list for version 2 (although I need to look again at <a href="http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=pgfplots">pgfplotstable</a> first, and see if it is worth the work).
