Lars Løge has reported a couple of errors with the `textmode` option in [siunitx](http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=siunitx).  One was rather harder to spot than the other, but both should be fixed in v1.2e, which has just gone to [CTAN](http://www.ctan.org).  I've also had some questions about table formatting with footnotes, but this is a “hard problem” and I'm not likely to alter the current behaviour in version 1.  It is on the list for version 2 (although I need to look again at [pgfplotstable](http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=pgfplots) first, and see if it is worth the work).
