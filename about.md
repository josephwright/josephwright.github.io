<h2>Who writes this stuff?</h2>

I'm Joseph Wright, a research chemist by trade (I'm a <a href="https://www.uea.ac.uk/chemistry/people/profile/joseph-wright">university lecturer in 'Energy Materials'</a>). Using and programming TeX (and particularly LaTeX) is quite a serious hobby for me, and I take an interest in a number of different developing areas. I'm also a member of the <a href="http://www.latex-project.org" title="The LaTeX Project Homepage">LaTeX Project</a>, with a particular interest in <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html" title="LaTeX3 Homepage">LaTeX3</a> development. If you  are chemistry-inclined my <a href="http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9603-1001">ORCiD listing</a>.

<h2>UK-TUG Committee</h2>

I am on the Committee of the <a href="http://uk.tug.org/">UK TeX User Group (UK-TUG)</a>, and am currently the Secretary. Anyone interested in TeX in the UK is encouraged to visit the group web page and consider joining.
