## Who writes this stuff?

I'm Joseph Wright, a research chemist by trade (I'm a [university lecturer in 'Energy Materials'](https://people.uea.ac.uk/en/persons/joseph-wright). Using and programming TeX (and particularly LaTeX) is quite a serious hobby for me, and I take an interest in a number of different developing areas. I'm also a member of the [LaTeX Project](https://www.latex-project.org), with a particular interest in [LaTeX3](https://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html) development. If you  are chemistry-inclined my [ORCiD listing](http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9603-1001).
