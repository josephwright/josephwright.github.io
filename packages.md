For the user I write quite a number of LaTeX packages, some focussed on chemistry, others more general. They are all available on [CTAN](https://www.ctan.org):

- [`achemso`](https://ctan.org/pkg/achemso): Support for submissions to American Chemical Society journals
- [`beamer`](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer): A LaTeX class for producing presentations and slides
- [`biblatex-chem`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-chem): Chemistry styles for `biblatex`
- [`biblatex-phys`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-phys): A `biblatex` implementation of the AIP and APS bibliography style
- [`biblatex-ieee`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-ieee): `biblatex` implementation of the _IEEE_ bibliography style
- [`biblatex-nature`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-nature): `biblatex` implementation of the _Nature_ bibliography style
- [`biblatex-science`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-science): `biblatex` implementation of the _Science_ bibliography style
- [`chemstyle`](https://ctan.org/pkg/chemstyle): Schemes and style for chemistry
- [`etoolbox`](https://ctan.org/pkg/etoolbox): e-TeX tools for LaTeX
- [`notes2bib`](https://ctan.org/pkg/notes2bib): Integrating notes into the bibliography
- [`pgfopts`](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgfopts): LaTeX package options with pgfkeys
- [`rsc`](https://ctan.org/pkg/rsc): BibTeX styles for Royal Society of Chemistry and Wiley journals
- [`siunitx`](https://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx): A comprehensive (SI) units package
- [`trivfloat`](https://ctan.org/pkg/trivfloat): Quick floats in LaTeX

The development work for all of these is done on [GitHub](https://github.com/josephwright): report any issues there! Keeping all of those up to date is sometimes a challenge, but I hope I do a reasonable job.
